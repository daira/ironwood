# Concrete composite-bound inputs for the captured Orchard shape

This module specializes the pinned AGM root budget to the captured Orchard verifier
dimensions while leaving the adversary query count explicit.  The resulting term is additive;
there is no continuation threshold or fourth-root conversion in this path.

/-! ## Pinned AGM root budget

The direct-root construction uses a conservative all-members/all-nodes union.  The wrapped
machine makes `11 + k = 22` extra reads and a one-squeeze root event costs
`Q + 22 + 1 = Q + 23` at `k = 11`.

/-! ## Reduction efficiency

The `dlogBound` premise below is the advantage of the *combined finder*, not of the raw adversary.
Its per-run cost model is kept outside Lean, like the random-oracle model itself: one run of the
wrapped adversary (`Q + 11 + k` oracle reads), one direct-coordinate decode of the retained
representations (field operations linear in the representation lists), and a constant number of
field solves.

`T = 2^122` cannot also be used as the combined finder's call budget.  At `k = 11`, the proved
AFK expectation is between `2^161` and `2^162` calls.  Making the generic Markov tail at most
`2^-86` would require `L+1` at least that expectation times `2^86`, a number between `2^247` and
`2^248`.  These facts correct the old `t ≈ T` interpretation; they do not claim that such a large
budget gives a useful concrete DLOG advantage.

The combined finder, not the raw adversary, is the DLOG solver.  Its unconditional expected
black-box call bound is `afkRunBound Q 11 + 3`: the AFK recursive bound plus the direct-coordinate
and quotient fallbacks.  The theorems below truncate that solver at the separate fixed budget `L`;
standard fixed-call DLOG hardness supplies `dlogBound`, and finite Markov conversion contributes
`(afkRunBound Q 11 + 3)/(L+1)`.  The query cap `T` still controls the statistical terms, but is not
itself the combined finder's running time. -/

contribution by `consensusPinnedRootMultiopenModel T`, the consensus-maximum term evaluated at
`≤ 2⁻⁸⁶` for `T = 2¹²²` above. The independent fixed solver budget `L` and its truncation tail
remain explicit. -/
