# Fiat–Shamir schedule check for the random single-action capture

The schedule checks of the honest families, restated at the random single-action capture: the
deployed verifier ran to completion on a random proof string (match-only — the capture is
deliberately non-accepting), and its replay recorded the schedule consumed here. `capturedFs`
returns a captured challenge only at its captured transcript prefix, converted by
`markerSchedule` to the model's marker encoding. `deriveChallenges_matches_captured_schedule`
pins the Lean schedule model at this generic input, and `nonInteractiveFingerprint_matches`
folds the schedule into the MSM match; `Boundary.lean` restates that match at the Lean-derived
verifying key as the family's statement of record.
