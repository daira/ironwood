# Aliveness guards for the random single-action capture

A match-only capture witnesses coefficient agreement without the accepting evaluation the honest
families carry, so it needs its own guards against being silently dead. Two live here:

- `valid_capture_assembles` — the model does not spuriously reject the random point. The trust
  boundary's transfer direction needs the model's accept set to contain the deployed one, and
  this witnesses the straight-line premise of `Core.ProofString` at a generic input.
- one blind-slot tamper canary — the match has bite at this point: bumping a `fixedEvals` slot
  still assembles but no longer matches. The full per-slot sensitivity sweep lives in the honest
  families (`Fixtures/{SingleAction,MultiAction}/Negative/Sweep.lean`), whose slot-naming
  regression coverage a random capture does not replace.

The third guard is generated rather than written here: `capturedMsm_evalNat_ne_zero`
(`Fixture.lean`) pins the capture as genuinely non-accepting, so a mislabeled honest capture or
dead export plumbing cannot pass for it. `TrustBoundary.lean` censuses it with the two above.

The rejection-path negatives of the honest families are deliberately absent: they exercise the
model's rejection set, which is challenge/VK-dependent and already covered there.
