# Fiat–Shamir schedule check for the two-action capture

The two-action analog of `Zcash.Snark.Fixtures.SingleAction.FiatShamir`, but with the challenge schedule
made concrete for this capture. Blake2b is intentionally taken at the random-oracle boundary; here
`capturedFs` acts as a fixture oracle over Rust-captured transcript events, returning each captured
challenge only when `deriveChallenges` presents the captured transcript prefix. This checks the
absorb/squeeze order for the typed verifier transcript after Blake2b initialization, then connects
the resulting FS-derived fingerprint (`nonInteractiveFingerprint`, i.e. `assemble` at
`deriveChallenges`) to the captured two-action MSM.

With `numProofs = 2` this check reaches the schedule's *per-sub-proof absorb interleavings* — all
proofs' advice commitments before `θ`, per-proof-per-lookup permuted pairs before `β`/`γ`, per-proof
evaluation blocks before `x₁`, and so on — which the single-action fixture exercises only at length 1.
A mis-ordered multi-proof absorb changes the transcript prefix presented to `capturedFs`, so the
`deriveChallenges_matches_captured_schedule` check fails.

This remains a fixture-oracle check over typed transcript events: generated `capturedInit` contains the
verifier-key transcript scalar and instance commitment events before the first proof-derived read, and
generated `capturedScheduleEntries` records the Rust verifier prefixes, including that captured prefix.

As with the generated fingerprint fixtures, the Rust capture/dumper boundary is trusted to emit the
typed proof fields, verifier-key transcript scalar, instance commitments, transcript-event trace, and
captured challenges corresponding to the deployed transcript; this file does not replay transcript
bytes.

TODO: once a general transcript-ordering theorem lands, either point this oracle at it or keep it as
a concrete regression for the captured proof.
