# The trust boundary at the Lean-derived key (multi-action)

The statement of record for the multi-action capture: the deployed verifier's fingerprint
— `assemble` at the challenges Lean's Fiat–Shamir schedule model derives from the captured
oracle — matches the captured MSM, with the verifying key spelled as its end-to-end
derivation from the ported `configure`/keygen at the captured URS
(`VkCertificate.lean`). The dumped verifying-key record no longer enters the comparison,
and the captured challenges are derived rather than taken as given.

The instance side stays `derivedInstanceCommitment` — already a derivation, the Lagrange
commitment of the captured public inputs, pinned to the captured points by
`instance_commitments_derived` — since the multi-action capture has no
`Keygen/InstanceCapture.lean` analogue.
