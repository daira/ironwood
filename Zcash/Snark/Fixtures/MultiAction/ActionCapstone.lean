# Exact Action soundness capstones

Issue #128's assembly: the captured static checks and `x`-squeeze schedule rebuilt at the
circuit-derived shape, the retained statement-or-relation intermediate, and the exact accepting
false-Action-statement endpoint closed by the combined computed relation finder.

The captured certificate remains at `actionProofParams.mergeDerived actionCircuit`, the derived
one-proof shape.  Its circuit-owned verifying-key fields never read `numProofs` or the URS, so the
captured facts transport to `actionProofParamsFor numProofs`.  The consensus-generic endpoints
therefore cover every permitted Orchard bundle size without rerunning key generation or capture.

## The adversary model

The public endpoint quantifies over `SequentialOnlineAGMProver`, a bounded sequential online-AGM
Fiat–Shamir adversary in the random-oracle model, against Vesta DLOG, together with its phased
Action execution.  The prover's stopped computations generate the deployed-root, IPA, and
constraint-`x` traces.  The Action phases emit typed snapshots before the five semantic squeezes;
their cuts and views are generated projections, never caller-supplied trace/cut objects.
The four semantic budgets are discharged inside the sequential endpoint from decided counting
caps; the hash-function boundary of the compressed model is unchanged.  The exact endpoint uses
the literal `accept ∧ ¬BundleStatement` event and one DLOG profile for all computed relation
branches.

/-! ## The sequential endpoint: every semantic budget discharged and counted

The counting caps below are decided at the captured key and transferred through the derived
key's field equalities, so the endpoint takes a bundle of cuts and views — the sequential
adversary — and nothing else numeric.  The caps are generous round powers of two: each sits
orders of magnitude under the field size, and the final margin analysis only needs
`(Q + 1) · Σcaps / |Fp|` small at `Q ≤ 2^123`.

Named assumptions: `hvk`/`hI` pin the family's key and instance commitments to the deployed

`profile` supplies the DLOG reduction; `cuts` is the sequential adversary itself, with its
