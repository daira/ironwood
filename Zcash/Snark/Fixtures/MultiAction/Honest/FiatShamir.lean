# Fiat–Shamir schedule check for the multi-action capture

This file checks the deployed absorb/squeeze order against a multi-action Rust capture and then
matches `nonInteractiveFingerprint` to the captured MSM; `Boundary.lean` restates that match at the
Lean-derived verifying key as the statement of record. `capturedFs` returns a captured challenge
only at its captured transcript prefix, converted by `markerSchedule` to the model's marker encoding.

With `numProofs = 2`, the check covers the per-proof absorb order that the single-action fixture cannot
distinguish. The Rust capture is trusted to provide the typed proof data, transcript events, and
challenges, not transcript bytes. General IPA ordering and sub-proof traversal are proved elsewhere;
this remains a concrete full-schedule regression.
