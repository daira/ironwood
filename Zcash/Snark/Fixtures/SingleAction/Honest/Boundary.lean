# The trust boundary at the Lean-derived key

The statement of record for the single-action capture: the deployed verifier's fingerprint
— `assemble` at the challenges Lean's Fiat–Shamir schedule model derives from the captured
oracle — matches the captured MSM, with the verifying key spelled as its end-to-end
derivation from the ported `configure`/keygen at the captured URS, and, in the strongest
form, the instance commitments spelled as the circuit's commitment of the captured public
inputs. The dumped verifying-key record no longer enters the comparison, and the captured
challenges are derived rather than taken as given.

Both theorems rewrite certificate equalities into the captured match — stating the boundary
at derived artifacts costs no new evaluation.
