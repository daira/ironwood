# Fiat–Shamir schedule check for the single-action capture

The single-action analog of `Zcash.Snark.Fixtures.MultiAction.FiatShamir`, on the same design: Blake2b
is intentionally taken at the random-oracle boundary; here `capturedFs` acts as a fixture oracle over
Rust-captured transcript events, returning each captured challenge only when `deriveChallenges`
presents the captured transcript prefix. This checks the absorb/squeeze order for the typed verifier
transcript after Blake2b initialization, and then connects the resulting FS-derived fingerprint
(`nonInteractiveFingerprint`, i.e. `assemble` at `deriveChallenges`) to the captured single-action MSM.
The per-sub-proof absorb interleavings are exercised at length 1 here; the multi-action coverage is
`Zcash.Snark.Fixtures.MultiAction.FiatShamir`.

As with the generated fingerprint fixtures, the Rust capture/dumper boundary is trusted to emit the
typed proof fields, verifier-key transcript scalar, instance commitments, transcript-event trace, and
captured challenges corresponding to the deployed transcript; this file does not replay transcript
bytes.

TODO: once a general transcript-ordering theorem lands, either point this oracle at it or keep it as
a concrete regression for the captured proof.
