# The trust boundary at the Lean-derived key (random single-action)

The statement of record for the random single-action capture: the deployed verifier's
fingerprint — `assemble` at the challenges Lean's Fiat–Shamir schedule model derives from the
captured oracle — matches the captured MSM, with the verifying key spelled as its end-to-end
derivation from the ported `configure`/keygen at the captured URS (`VkCertificate.lean`). The
dumped verifying-key record no longer enters the comparison, the captured challenges are
derived rather than taken as given — from `initialTranscript` at those derived artifacts, not
from the dumped `capturedInit`, which `capturedInit_eq_initialTranscript` shows are the same
prefix.

Because the proof string is random, this is the statement the whole random family exists for:
the slots whose honest values are recomputable — `fixedEvals`, `permutationCommonEvals`,
`instanceEvals` — carry random values here, so a sourcing swap or recompute-shortcut in
`assemble` mismatches instead of hiding behind honest structure.

The instance side stays `derivedInstanceCommitment` — already a derivation, the Lagrange
commitment of the captured public inputs, pinned to the captured points by
`instance_commitments_derived` — since only the honest single-action capture has a
`Keygen/InstanceCapture.lean` analogue.
