# The fingerprint match

The cross-check that validates the Lean assembly against the deployed Rust verifier (in place of a
line-by-line translation proof): run the deployed verifier on a proof, capturing its assembled MSM and
the challenges it drew; run the Lean `assembleFinalMsm` on the same proof string and challenges; and
compare the two MSMs. A match means the two assembly *formulas* agree.

This module provides the match's logical content:

* `MsmMatch` — two MSMs match iff their `g`/`w`/`u` coefficients are equal and their `other` term lists
  agree up to reordering (`List.Perm`), and `msmMatch_eval` shows a match implies equal evaluations (the
  term sum is order-independent). Both sides use the same proof commitments as the bases (the Lean
  assembly's `G` elements are the captured proof's commitments), so the bases agree by construction and
  the match reduces to the `F_p` scalar coefficients, with `other` compared as a multiset since assembly
  order is immaterial.
* `fingerprint_match_random_eval_sound` — the soundness of the cheaper random-evaluation match: viewing
  a coefficient difference as a polynomial in the proof scalars and challenges, a uniformly random
  evaluation fails to witness a real mismatch only with probability `≤ d / p` (Schwartz–Zippel, via
  `fingerprint_schwartz_zippel`). This is a generic statement about an abstract polynomial; it is *not*
  instantiated at `assemble`'s actual coefficient differences (no degree bound proved for them, no union
  bound across terms), so "one random proof suffices up to `d / p`" is not yet a Lean link. The numeric
  fixture match (`native_decide`) establishes agreement on one captured proof, full stop.
* `gScalars_card` — the structural cross-check: the assembled MSM carries `2 ^ k` SRS-generator
  coefficients, matching the captured Orchard fingerprint's `2 ^ 11 = 2048`.

## What remains external

The Rust capture lives in the personal forks: the capture APIs (`FingerprintStrategy`,
`ChallengeRecorder`, `MSM::fingerprint_terms`) in
[TalDerei/halo2#1](https://github.com/TalDerei/halo2/pull/1), and the capture test in
[TalDerei/orchard#1](https://github.com/TalDerei/orchard/pull/1). Running the numeric match on the real
capture needs that captured fixture (the `2048` g-scalars, `100` commitment terms, and `22` challenges)
serialized and loaded, the verifying key supplied as a `VerifyingKey`, and the `construct_intermediate_sets`
grouping (the one piece `assembleFinalMsm` takes as input). With those, the match is the decidable
coefficient comparison `MsmMatch` above. The group bases stay abstract in Lean (the Pasta curve law is
hand-waved), so the numeric comparison is of the scalar coefficients, with the bases shared by construction.
In the fixture the bases are opaque `ℕ` tags (`G := ℕ`), so the match says nothing about the Vesta curve:
the faithfulness "same `ℕ` tag ⇔ same Vesta point" lives in the Rust capture, not in Lean.

/-- Two MSMs match iff their SRS-generator coefficients and the `w`/`u` coefficients are equal, and
their `other` term lists agree up to reordering (`List.Perm`). The MSM is
`Σᵢ gScalarsᵢ • gᵢ + wScalar • w + uScalar • u + Σ (c • P)`; the final term sum is order-independent, so
a permutation of `other` denotes the same MSM and the same evaluation (`msmMatch_eval`). The term order
is only a serialization artifact of how each assembler appends, hence the order-insensitivity there. -/

order-independent. -/

/-- Soundness of the random-evaluation match (Schwartz–Zippel). A coefficient of the assembled MSM
minus the captured one is a polynomial `p` in the proof scalars and challenges; the two MSMs genuinely
differ in that coefficient exactly when `p ≠ 0`. Then the fraction of challenge/scalar assignments at
which the coefficient nonetheless agrees — a false match at a uniformly random evaluation — is at most
`deg p / p_field`. So a single random evaluation detects a mismatch except with probability `≤ d / p`,
and one random proof validates the assembly up to that bound. This is `fingerprint_schwartz_zippel`
applied to the coefficient difference. -/
