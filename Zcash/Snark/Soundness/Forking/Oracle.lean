# Random-oracle model for Fiat–Shamir

`Verifier.FiatShamir` derives challenges with an abstract `squeeze`. The deployed verifier uses
Blake2b. The soundness proof models it as a random function with uniform answers that can be changed
at one query.

This module supplies the random-oracle primitives the forking development is framed with:

* `uniformChallenge` and `uniformChallenge_badSet` model a fresh field challenge and its probability
  of landing in a finite bad set.

Reprogramming — the rewinding primitive itself — is `reprogramRounds` in
`Soundness.Forking.Rewind`, which replaces the whole IPA round vector at once.

## Challenge-vector distribution

The forking proof uses the uniform distribution on IPA challenge vectors.
`Soundness.Forking.Rewind.roChallenges_ipaRound_uniform` derives that distribution for a fixed proof
from one assumption:

> **Random oracle.** The Blake2b squeeze is idealized as a *uniform random function* `O` over its query domain.

Each round reads `O` at a distinct transcript prefix, so the answers are independent and uniform.
This also assumes that transcript encoding is injective and that halo2's `Challenge255 → Fp`
conversion is exactly uniform. The real conversion has a negligible, unaccounted reduction bias.

Thus the challenge distribution is proved inside the random-oracle model, while the model itself
remains an assumption about Blake2b.

## Layer boundary

This module defines the random-oracle model only. `Forking.Adversary` supplies the bounded-query
forger, `Forking.Recursive` computes its fork certificate, and `Forking.Algebraic` carries the real
attack event through the AGM reduction.

`uniformChallenge_badSet` is used directly for the `1/p` blinding budget.

The remaining deployment assumption is that Blake2b behaves as this random oracle.
