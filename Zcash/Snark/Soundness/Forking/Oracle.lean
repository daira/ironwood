# Random-oracle model for Fiat–Shamir

`Verifier.FiatShamir` derives challenges with an abstract `squeeze`; the deployed verifier uses
Blake2b. The soundness proof models it as a random function with uniform answers, changeable at
one query. This module supplies the two primitives the forking development is framed with:
`reprogram`, which changes the answer at one transcript prefix, and `uniformChallenge` with
`uniformChallenge_badSet`, a fresh field challenge and its chance of landing in a finite bad set.

## Challenge-vector distribution

`Rewind.roChallenges_ipaRound_uniform` derives the uniform distribution on IPA challenge vectors
for a fixed proof from one assumption: the Blake2b squeeze is a uniform random function `O` over
its query domain. Each round reads `O` at a distinct prefix, so the answers are independent and
uniform. This also assumes injective transcript encoding and an exactly uniform
`Challenge255 → Fp` conversion. The distribution is therefore proved inside the model; the model
itself stays an assumption about Blake2b.

## The `Challenge255 → Fp` conversion bias

The deployed conversion is not exactly uniform. Halo2 reduces a fixed-width byte string modulo
`p`, which leaves each residue with probability `⌊2^w/p⌋/2^w` or `⌈2^w/p⌉/2^w`. Summed over `Fp`
that is a total-variation distance of at most `|Fp| / 2^w` per squeeze, so a `q`-squeeze run loses
at most `q · |Fp| / 2^w` — the same `q` that `Adversary.OracleComp` already charges query loss
against.

`badSet_measure_le_of_bias` is where the term attaches: it carries any bad-set bound proved
against `uniformChallenge` over to a biased law at an additive `ε`. Instantiating `ε` needs `w`
for the deployed transcript, a fact about halo2's transcript code recorded in the trust boundary
rather than proved here.

## What the adversary model still assumes

The querying-adversary experiment is present: `Adversary.OracleComp` models a bounded-query
adversary, `Adversary.Algebraic` decodes its deployed transcript into the representation-carrying
proof the AGM reduction reads, and the straight-line endpoints in
`Composition.StraightLineConstraint` price failure from the adversary's own advantage. Query loss
is charged explicitly: `(Q + 1) · (1/p)` per pinned squeeze and for the adaptive `z = 0` slice.
What remains is:

* **Efficiency modeling.** The deployed combined finder has a pointwise four-invocation bound
  (`straightLineConstraintRelationFinderCalls_le_four`), so no expected-runs analysis enters the
  accounting. PPT-ness of the adversary family is external to Lean.
* **The idealizations.** Blake2b as a random function, the conversion bias above, the AGM,
  plain-DL hardness, and the generator random-oracle model.

The `Fp`-squeeze exclusions — the Schwartz–Zippel `d / p`, the `z ≠ 0` and `ξ`-recovery `1 / p`
singletons, and any further point exclusions — combine into one subadditive bound by
`GoodChallenge.uniformChallenge_szBadSet_union`.

Halo2's real `Challenge255 → Fp` conversion is a modular reduction of a fixed-width byte string and
so is only within total-variation distance `|Fp| / 2^w` of this law, for the conversion width `w`.
`badSet_measure_le_of_bias` charges that deviation; no bound in this development silently assumes
it away. -/

If the real squeeze law `D` overshoots `uniformChallenge` by at most `ε` on every event — the
`ε = |Fp| / 2^w` of the module doc, for a `w`-bit conversion — then every bad-set bound proved in
the uniform model holds for `D` with `ε` added. The hypothesis is the assumption; the point of
stating it is that the term now has a name and a home instead of living in the word "negligible". -/
