# Soundness composition: conditional, and the deployed accept condition

This module composes IPA knowledge soundness into SNARK-relation soundness for the Orchard
verifier, in two layers:

* the `_conditional` family, over an opaque `accepts : Prop`. The suffix avoids overclaiming:
  these are scaffolds, not finished soundness.
* the deployed family, over the concrete accept `DeployedAccepts`: the rejecting `assemble?`
  succeeds and its MSM — the *fingerprint*, the transcribed form of halo2's final verifier
  check — evaluates to the group identity.

## The deployed route

The route derives the IPA opening and the gate constraint with `P`/`v` *pinned* to the proof's
`multiopenCommitment`/`multiopenValue` (read off `(vk, ps, ch)`, not free parameters; the
commitment is opened up to its declared blinding — see
`The tree opens the commitment up to declared U/W components` below):

1. `deployedAccepts_verifierEq` (*proven*) — the accept entails halo2's explicit IPA verifier
   equation `DeployedIpaVerifierEq`. Fidelity of that closed form to the Rust is the
   transcription layer (`assembleFinalMsm`/`ipaFold`, checked by the fingerprint), not re-proved
   here.
2. `FiatShamirTree` (*residual*) — the equation yields a forked transcript
   (`ForkedTranscript`, as data): the deployed tree opening the pinned `P`/`v`; bundles the
   Fiat–Shamir forking with the extraction content it supplies (inventory in its docstring).
   `ForkedTranscript.ofAccepts` composes steps 1–2.
3. The fork *either* peels cleanly onto `IpaAcceptV` — then `ipa_soundV` extracts the opening
   witness and `orchard_verifier_deployed_opening_of_forked`/`_constraint_of_forked` conclude
   `S` — *or* `NontrivialRelation.ofUnopenedFork` (*proven*, via
   `NontrivialRelation.ofDeployedTree`) computes a discrete-log relation among `(g, U, W)`,
   which DLR hardness forbids.

## The reduction form

Commitment binding is load-bearing in the peel, but the statements assume no independence of
`(g, U, W)`: in a prime-order group a nontrivial relation always *exists*, so that assumption
would be false — and a `… ∨ ∃-relation` conclusion would be propositionally `True`. Per the
breaks-as-computed-data convention (`Zcash.Security.RandomOracle`, and the Ironwood Book's
formal-verification conventions), the relation is instead *computed*: `NontrivialRelation`
carries the coefficients as data, the reductions are plain `def`s, and the positive soundness
statement is the contrapositive under DLR hardness — no efficient adversary can produce what
`NontrivialRelation.ofUnopenedFork` computes, so the clean opening holds. The binding-signature
argument makes the same move (`NontrivialRelation.ofImbalance` in
`Zcash.Security.BindingSignature.Balance`).

## Assumptions (the conditional family)

* **Opaque accept.** `accepts` is a free `Prop`, so `orchard_verifier_sound_conditional` says
  nothing about the fingerprint. The `_deployed` variants take `DeployedAccepts` instead.
* **Extraction bundled with Fiat–Shamir.** `ExtractableFromAcceptance` assumes the IPA
  knowledge-soundness conclusion, so the proven extraction lemmas (`accepting_fold_eq`,
  `extract_correct`) are off this path.
* **Circuit satisfaction assumed.** It also supplies `circuitSat a` rather than deriving it from
  the deployed gate check (`constraint_identity_of_accept` + the multiopen decode).

What is proven lives in the component lemmas (`extract_correct`, `accepting_fold_eq`,
`quotientCheck_sound`, and the computed binding reduction `NontrivialDLRelation.ofCollision`);
the open work is wiring
them onto this path. `Soundness.Vesta` instantiates the capstones at the concrete curve;
`Soundness.KnowledgeSoundness` lists the assumptions.

/-- Assumption: if the proof is accepted, there exist a consistent transcript tree and a witness
`a` opening the commitment (`IpaRelation urs P b v a`) and satisfying the circuit
(`circuitSat a`). This assumes more than Fiat–Shamir: it bundles the extraction conclusion that
`accepting_fold_eq`/`extract_correct` already prove, so those lemmas are off this path; splitting
the two apart is open. -/

-- Tracked semantic-adequacy gap: `S` is a free `Prop` and `hencodes` an assumed hypothesis, so

-- VK-correctness gap (see `Verifier/Assemble.lean`). Large; not started.
/-- **Conditional soundness (the scaffold).** *If* acceptance yields the extraction data
(`hextract`), then the statement `S` follows via `hencodes`. `accepts` is opaque and the
extraction is assumed (see the module docstring's assumption list); the deployed
`_opening`/`_constraint` theorems below take the concrete accept and derive what is assumed
here. -/

/-- The deployed verifier's accept condition: `assemble? vk ps ch` succeeds and the assembled MSM
evaluates to the group identity against the URS. Proof data that `assemble?` rejects (duplicate
queries, a mismatched `multiopenU` count, malformed permutation last-evals, zero inverse
denominators) is `False`. `hk` aligns the circuit shape's `k` with the URS's. -/

`Iff`: the converse is a completeness claim, not made here. This discharges the MSM↔equation
correspondence the Fiat–Shamir bridge used to absorb; what the bridge still supplies is
inventoried at `FiatShamirTree`. -/

/-! ## `IpaRelation` is derived from the transcript tree, not assumed

`Zcash.Snark.ipa_soundV` derives the full opening relation — `commit g a = P` and `⟨a,b⟩ = v` —
from an accepting IPA transcript tree (`IpaAcceptV`), binding-free, by 3-special soundness. So the
bridge no longer assumes `IpaRelation`; the MSM↔equation correspondence and the `P`/`v` pinning it
used to also absorb are discharged (`deployedAccepts_verifierEq`), and the `g`/`U`/`W` separation
is derived — its failure computes a relation (`NontrivialRelation.ofDeployedTree`). What the
bridge still absorbs beyond the rewinding is inventoried at `FiatShamirTree` below. -/

/-! ## The tree opens the commitment up to declared `U`/`W` components

Every deployed commitment is blinded: `deployedCommitment` is an MSM over the proof's commitment
points, each carrying a `W`-blind, so as a group element it has a nonzero `W`-component. The
tree's commitment track, by contrast, ends in the pure `g`-span (the leaf's `P = ⟨aP, g⟩`), and
the accept forces the opened commitment's `U`/`W`-components to `0` — at each node the three
child equations at distinct challenges Vandermonde-pin them. Opening the raw `deployedCommitment`
would therefore be unsatisfiable for every real proof. So the bridge *declares* those components
(`ForkedTranscript.pU`/`pW`; honest values `0` and the aggregate blind), and the tree opens
`deployedCommitment − [pU]u − [pW]w`. The declaration is itself pinned up to a break: two
declarations for one commitment collide into a computed relation
(`NontrivialRelation.ofCombinationCollision`). Satisfiability is checked, not asserted:
`ForkedTranscript.nonempty_of_opening` builds a transcript from any blinded opening. -/

/-- A forked deployed transcript, as data: the tree the Fiat–Shamir forking would produce, with
its accept certificate. It opens the declared commitment `deployedCommitment − [pU]u − [pW]w`
(the section note above) to the pinned `multiopenValue`. Carried as data, not behind an `∃`, so
the peel can *compute* a discrete-log relation from it (see `The reduction form` in the module
docstring). -/

witness (`deployedIpaAcceptV_of_witness`). Honest proofs have exactly this shape (`pU = 0`,

/-- The forking bridge — the *residual* assumption. Its premise is halo2's explicit verifier
equation `DeployedIpaVerifierEq` (which `deployedAccepts_verifierEq` proves the deployed accept
entails); it produces a `ForkedTranscript`. It bundles the Fiat–Shamir *forking* with the
special-soundness *extraction* content the forked transcripts would pin by Vandermonde over the
augmented `(g, U, W)` basis, here arriving as bridge-supplied tree data:

(a) the rewinding producing three accepting continuations per node at distinct nonzero challenges;
(b) the node-level `L`/`R` ↦ value/blinding decomposition (`Lv`/`Rv`/`Lw`/`Rw` — each round
    point's `(g, U, W)`-representation, which must not depend on `z`);
(c) the leaf `g`-representation `aP` of the folded commitment (`DeployedIpaTreeV`'s leaf data);
    and
(d) the commitment's declared `U`/`W` components `pU`/`pW` (the section note above) and the
    adjusted-commitment step `P' = P − [v]g₀ + [ξ]S`: re-expressing the value term and the
    `S`/`ξ` blinding poly against the declared opening needs a representation of the adversary
    point `S` (ξ-side rewinding or AGM), so it is not a deterministic rewrite.

Deriving (a)–(d) under random-oracle Fiat–Shamir is open. The per-leaf `g`/`U`/`W` separation is
*derived* — its failure computes a relation (`NontrivialRelation.ofDeployedTree`) — but `S`/`ξ`
is not peeled, it lives in (d). `b`/`z`/`blind` are bridge-mediated (the protocol fixes
`b = evalVector urs.k ch.x3`, telescoping at the leaf to `b₀ = computeB ch.x3 ·`, and
`z = ch.z`); `v` is pinned, and `P` is pinned up to the declared `pU`/`pW`. -/

/-! ## The constraint-side hypotheses are unsatisfiable at a prime-order curve

`hcirc` below (and `hquot`/`hgood` in the constraint variant) quantify over *every* mathematical
opening `a` of the pinned `(P, b, v)`. At a prime-order curve those openings form an affine
subspace of dimension `≥ 2^k − 2` (two linear conditions on `2^k` coordinates), so any
`circuitSat` that genuinely reads the witness fails on almost all of it: the hypotheses are
unsatisfiable for the intended instantiation, not merely undischarged.
`circuitSatViaGates_of_check` does not help — it derives `circuitSat` for *one* `a` from that
`a`'s own point-check, never the quantified premise.

The implication: the `_of_forked` theorems below currently carry no gate-level content — they
conclude `S` only for `circuitSat` instantiations that ignore the witness, so no soundness for
the deployed circuit's constraints follows from them yet. Their opening side stands on its own;
the constraint side is a scaffold until it is restated over the *extracted* witness via the
multiopen decode (`batch_open_soundV`), which is still open. -/

/-- **The deployed binding reduction, as a computed relation.** A forked transcript whose
projection is *not* cleanly accepted computes a nontrivial discrete-log relation among the
augmented generators — `NontrivialRelation.ofDeployedTree` at the declared opening

/-! ## `circuitSat` is derived from the verifier's gate check + Schwartz–Zippel

The constraint side mirrors the opening side. The verifier checks the gate identity only at the
challenge `x` — a point check (`quotientCheck`: `numerator.eval x = h.eval x · (xⁿ−1)`).
`circuitSatViaGates_of_check` lifts that point check to the polynomial identity
`circuitSatViaGates` (the witness's decoded columns satisfy the gates) provided `x` avoids the
Schwartz–Zippel *bad set* — the roots of the difference polynomial when it is nonzero, which is
what `hgood` excludes. So `circuitSat`, instantiated to the concrete `circuitSatViaGates`, is
derived from the verifier's actual gate check rather than taken as an opaque hypothesis. -/
