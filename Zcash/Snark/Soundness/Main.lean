# Soundness composition: conditional, and the deployed accept condition

This module formalizes the composition that turns IPA knowledge soundness into the SNARK relation, in
two layers: a `_conditional` family over an opaque `accepts : Prop`, and a `_deployed` family over the
concrete accept condition `(assemble vk ps ch).eval … = 0` (the §1 fingerprint MSM). The conditional
theorems are named with a `_conditional` suffix to avoid overclaiming: they are scaffolds, not finished
soundness. The deployed `_opening` / `_constraint` theorems below derive the IPA opening (via
`ipa_soundV`) and the gate constraint from the accept, under the Fiat–Shamir bridge `hFS`. (An earlier
deployed layer that peeled `U`/`W`/`S` was removed; re-expressing binding as a DLR-hardness
reduction — see `relation_of_collision` in `Zcash.Snark.Soundness.CommitFold` — is the planned follow-up.)

## Assumptions (the conditional family)

* **Opaque accept.** `accepts` is a free `Prop`, not instantiated to the deployed accept condition, so
  `orchard_verifier_sound_conditional` says nothing about the fingerprint. The `_deployed` variants fix
  this by taking `DeployedAccepts`.
* **Extraction bundled with Fiat–Shamir.** `ExtractableFromAcceptance` assumes the IPA
  knowledge-soundness conclusion (a consistent transcript tree + a valid opening), bundling Fiat–Shamir
  with the extraction that `accepting_fold_eq` / `extract_correct` prove — so those proven lemmas are
  off this path.
* **Circuit satisfaction assumed, not derived.** `ExtractableFromAcceptance` also supplies `circuitSat a`
  rather than deriving it from the deployed constraint check via `constraint_identity_of_accept` and the
  multiopen decode.
* **Binding inert.** `hbind` (DLR hardness) reaches `knowledge_sound` but only feeds its uniqueness
  conjunct, which this proof discards.

What is proven lives in the component lemmas (`extract_correct`, `accepting_fold_eq`, `commitGen_round`,
`quotientCheck_sound`, `ipaRelation_unique`, the binding reduction, `eval_combineGates`); the open work
is wiring them onto this path. `Zcash.Snark.Soundness.Vesta` instantiates these at the concrete Vesta curve. See
`Zcash.Snark.Soundness.KnowledgeSoundness` for the assumption list.

/-- Assumed: acceptance yields the IPA extraction data, which is stronger than just Fiat–Shamir. Given
`accepts`, this hands over a consistent transcript tree and a valid opening — i.e. it assumes the IPA
knowledge-soundness *conclusion* that `accepting_fold_eq` / `extract_correct` produce, bundled with
Fiat–Shamir. Honest reading: assume IPA knowledge soundness + FS, not hand-wave only FS. Splitting this
into the genuine FS step (`accept → ∃ tree`) and the proven extraction — narrowing the residual to
"challenges are uniform and unpredictable" — is open. It also bundles `circuitSat a` (the extracted
witness satisfies the circuit); deriving that from the deployed constraint check is likewise open. -/

-- TODO(semantic adequacy): `hencodes`/`S` below are the seam from circuit-satisfiability to the
-- high-level Orchard relation. `S` is a free `Prop` and `hencodes` is an assumed hypothesis, so the
-- chain stops at "the extracted witness satisfies the gates" (`SnarkRelation`) and never reaches
-- "…therefore a valid Orchard action" (note well-formed, value balances, nullifier correctly derived,
-- spend authorized). Closing it: instantiate `S` to the concrete Orchard statement and prove `hencodes`.
-- The composition reaches only `SnarkRelation`; this is the output-side dual of the input-side
-- VK-correctness gap (see `Verifier/Assemble.lean`). Large; not started.
/-- Conditional soundness composition (not completed soundness). From the assumed extraction data
(`hextract haccepts`, which also yields `circuitSat a`), conclude `S` via `hencodes`.

This assumes what §2 should prove: `accepts` is opaque (the `_deployed` variant fixes that); the
extraction + circuit-satisfaction are assumed (so `accepting_fold_eq` / `extract_correct` /
`constraint_identity_of_accept` are off-path); and `hbind`'s binding only feeds the discarded uniqueness
conjunct. The scaffold for the composition, not the composition — see the module docstring, and the
deployed `_opening` / `_constraint` theorems below. -/

/-! ## `IpaRelation` is derived from the transcript tree, not assumed

`Zcash.Snark.ipa_soundV` derives the full opening relation — `commit g a = P` and `⟨a,b⟩ = v` — from an
accepting IPA transcript tree (`IpaAcceptV`), binding-free, by 3-special soundness. So the bridge no
longer assumes `IpaRelation`. Honest caveat for `FiatShamirTree` below: it is not purely the rewinding —
it also absorbs (i) the MSM↔tree structural correspondence (that `assemble.eval = 0` unfolds into the
recursive checks for the proof's actual `P,b,v,L,R`) and (ii) the pinning of free `P,b,v` to the proof.
The cryptographic opening is genuinely derived; the residual bundle is structural. -/

/-- `IpaAcceptV` over the URS generators derives `IpaRelation`: the witness `ipa_soundV` extracts opens
`P` (`commit urs a = commitGen urs.g a`) and gives the inner product (`commitGen b a = ⟨a,b⟩`). The IPA
opening is derived, not assumed. -/

/-- The transcript-tree bridge: acceptance yields a clean `IpaAcceptV` tree. Beyond the rewinding proper,
this absorbs (i) the MSM↔tree structural correspondence (that `assemble.eval = 0` unfolds into the
recursive checks for the proof's `P,b,v,L,R`) and (ii) the `U`/`W`/`S` separation (since `IpaAcceptV` is
the blinding-free IPA). The cryptographic opening it feeds is then derived by `ipa_soundV`
(`ipaRelation_of_acceptV`), not assumed. An earlier development discharged (ii) and the flat half of (i)
via a dedicated deployed layer; that layer was removed pending a DLR-hardness reduction, so for now the
separation and the structural correspondence are bundled back into this bridge. -/

/-- The deployed Orchard verifier is sound, opening derived. From the deployed accept (`assemble.eval = 0`),
the minimal Fiat–Shamir bridge `hFS` (acceptance yields the transcript tree — the only IPA assumption),
and the circuit-satisfaction of the opening (`hcirc`, the constraint side, dischargeable by
`circuitSatViaGates_of_check`), conclude `S`.

The IPA opening (`IpaRelation`) is derived here via `ipaRelation_of_acceptV`/`ipa_soundV`, not assumed (the
earlier conditional bridges that bundled it have been removed). Honest scope: `hFS` still absorbs the
MSM↔tree correspondence + `P,b,v` pinning (see `FiatShamirTree`), and `hcirc` is the assumed constraint
side, which `orchard_verifier_sound_deployed_constraint` derives from the gate check. Named
assumptions: the bridge (`hFS`), the constraint side (`hcirc`), and VK-correctness (`hencodes`). -/

/-! ## `circuitSat` is derived from the verifier's gate check + Schwartz–Zippel

The constraint side mirrors the opening side. The verifier checks the gate identity only at the challenge
`x` — a point check (`quotientCheck`, `numerator.eval x = h.eval x · (xⁿ−1)`). `circuitSatViaGates_of_check`
lifts that point check to the polynomial identity `circuitSatViaGates` (the witness's decoded columns
satisfy the gates) provided `x` avoids the Schwartz–Zippel bad set (`hgood`). So `circuitSat`, instantiated
to the concrete `circuitSatViaGates`, is derived from the verifier's actual gate check — no black-box
`hcirc`. -/

/-- The deployed Orchard verifier is sound, opening and constraint both derived. Both conjuncts of
`SnarkRelation` are derived, not assumed: `IpaRelation` (the opening) from the transcript tree via
`ipa_soundV`; and `circuitSat` — instantiated to `circuitSatViaGates` — from the verifier's quotient/gate
point check `hquot` at the challenge `x`, lifted to the polynomial identity by Schwartz–Zippel (`hgood`),
via `circuitSatViaGates_of_check`.

The black-box `hcirc` is gone. What remains are the verifier's actual checks and the standard assumptions:
the special-soundness rewinding tree (`hFS`), the gate point-check (`hquot`), the SZ good challenge
(`hgood`), and VK-correctness (`hencodes`). `hquot`/`hgood` are the constraint-side analog of `hFS` — the
gate check is part of `assemble.eval = 0` modulo the multiopen decode that ties the opened columns to it. -/
