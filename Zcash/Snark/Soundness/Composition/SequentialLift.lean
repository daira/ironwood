# Sequential online-AGM provers lift to the staged family

The adversary-coverage theorem of issue #127: any Fiat–Shamir prover presented in its own
execution order — a pre-`x` phase, one query at its `x` squeeze point, a continuation — admits
the staged constraint-`x` chronology, so it lifts to the full staged family with its run
function, and hence its outputs, acceptance probability, and query bound, unchanged.

The model (`SequentialPreXProver`) is purely structural.  Its fields name the prover's internal
state, its pre-`x` computation, its own `x` squeeze point, and the pre-`x` *view* — the messages
it has emitted before the `x` query.  No field mentions a bad event, a decode, or a polynomial;
the lifting proves the total constraint difference is computable from the view because the
difference reads nothing the prover has not yet emitted.

The root and IPA traces are intrinsic to the family the lift extends; the lift adds the one
chronology layer issue #127 changed.
