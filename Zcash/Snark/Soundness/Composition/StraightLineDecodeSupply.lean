# The algebraic decode behind the straight-line constraint event

`straightLineConstraintDecoded` is proposition-only: it says the root decode succeeded and yielded
a constraint witness, but hands out no data.  The Action terminal needs the data — a
`DeployedAlgebraicDecode` at the run's own artifacts.

`straightLineConstraintDecoded_nonempty_decode` recovers the decode as a `Nonempty`, and
`straightLineDecode` picks one.  The decode is pinned by `family.outcome`, so the choice cannot
invent different AGM coordinates — `DeployedRootDecodeWitness.unique`.

The artifacts are the run's, not the Action circuit's.  Identifying the two is the caller's job;
`ActionTerminal.action_bundleStatement_or_relation_of_straightLineDecoded` does it with the keygen
certificate equalities.

/-- Re-round a decode.  No decode field reads the record's IPA rounds, so a decode at one round
vector is a decode at any other; every field transports by `rfl`.  Deployed acceptance is *not*
round-blind — the final IPA equation reads `ch.ipaRound` — which is why the root layer's
zero-round record and an accepting run's true record need this bridge at all. -/
