# Composite constraint bound for the rewind-free AGM path

This module carries any additional explicit relation produced while upgrading the deployed member
decode to the concrete constraint relation through the same textbook-DLOG finder.  The remaining
`x`-challenge failure is an additive event supplied by the concrete pre-`x` schedule; no multiopen
rewind or fourth-root threshold appears.

Inhabited twice.  `Composition.StraightLineWitness` does it at the degenerate witness shape;
`Composition.ZeroStraightLine` does it over the shape-generic zero prover, and
`Fixtures.MultiAction.CapturedZeroFamily` instantiates that at the captured key's own scalar
metadata, layouts and domain — so the six staged root events run against captured query layouts
and the staged IPA trace carries eleven live rounds rather than quantifying over `Fin 0`.

The total event of issue #127 removed this interface's old decode guard, so the zero prover
also inhabits it at the full captured shape (`Fixtures.MultiAction.CapturedZeroFamily`): with
sub-proofs the pre-`x` difference is a nonzero polynomial, and the stage prices its root set
from the four folding squeezes alone.

/-! ## Promotion from the compressed identity to circuit semantics

The constraint witness above proves the verifier's identity only after `y` has compressed the
constraint list and `beta`, `gamma`, and `theta` have compressed the permutation and lookup values.
Calling that semantic circuit satisfaction is unsound without pricing collisions at those four
earlier squeezes. The interface below makes the step explicit: the caller supplies the semantic
predicate, the four failure events, and a proof that a compressed witness outside them has the
intended semantics.
-/

/-- Outside the four challenge-failure events, a compressed constraint witness upgrades to the
caller's row-level semantic predicate. In a concrete Orchard instantiation, `ConstraintRelations`
supplies this implication from the good-`y` fold split, good permutation `beta`/`gamma`, and good
lookup-tuple `theta` hypotheses. -/
