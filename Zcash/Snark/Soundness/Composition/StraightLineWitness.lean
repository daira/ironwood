# The straight-line deployed family interface is inhabited

`PinnedRootWitness` exhibits `witnessDeployedRootFamily`, an executable inhabitant of the deployed
root interface at the degenerate witness shape.  This module extends it to the two stronger
interfaces layered above it:

* `ComputedDeployedConstraintFSFamily`, by an executable constraint-`x` stage.  The witness data's
  constraint difference is the zero polynomial — the shape has no proofs, so the combined
  constraint list is empty, and `n = 0` collapses the quotient term — so the stage returns the
  empty root set without reading the oracle at all.
* `ComputedStraightLineDeployedFSFamily`, additionally carrying the staged IPA trace.  The witness
  shape has no IPA rounds (`k = 0`), so the per-round trace obligations are vacuous.

That second point is this witness's limit: the interface is consistent and its constraint-`x`
stage concrete, but the IPA-round stages quantify over `Fin 0` and so go unexercised.
`Composition.ZeroStraightLine` is the model with live rounds, instantiated at captured key data by
`Fixtures.MultiAction.Honest.CapturedZeroFamily`, and it consumes the zero-coordinate keystone at the end
of this module.

/-! ## Zero-coordinate IPA walks, at any shape

The witness shape has no IPA rounds, so its staged trace is vacuous.  The lemmas below are the
shape-generic keystone a captured-shape constant family will need instead: a proof whose aggregate
and round coordinates vanish walks the zero discrepancy, so every straight-line IPA root
polynomial — at any `k`, for every challenge vector — is the zero polynomial, and
`stage := pure 0` satisfies `agrees` and `fresh` outright.
