# The straight-line deployed interface, inhabited with live IPA rounds

`zeroStraightLineDeployedFamily` inhabits the straight-line deployed interface over the
shape-generic zero prover, with the IPA-round obligations live: at `k = 11` the staged trace
carries eleven rounds, each discharged by `straightLineIpaRootPolynomial_of_zero_coordinates`
rather than by an empty index type.  `Composition.StraightLineWitness` inhabits the same
interface at the witness shape, where `k = 0` empties those obligations.

Two hypotheses carry it.  The key's two group-valued commitment families are zero, which is what
the zero prover's assembly needs.  And the shape is instance-free, which is what discharges the
constraint layer: with no sub-proofs the folded constraint list is empty and the decoded quotient
pieces have zero coordinates, so the pre-`x` constraint difference is the zero polynomial and the
constraint-`x` root set is empty on every table.

The instance-free hypothesis is a simplification, not a boundary.  With issue #127's total
constraint-`x` event, `zeroConstStraightLineDeployedFamily` below discharges every obligation at
any shape: the constant-walk IPA trace leaves the multiopen value free, and the constraint-`x`
stage prices the explicit zero-data difference from the four folding squeezes alone.
`Fixtures.MultiAction.CapturedZeroFamily` instantiates it with both sub-proofs live.
