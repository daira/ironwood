# Knowledge soundness, end to end

The capstone: an accepting proof demonstrates knowledge of a witness satisfying the SNARK relation. It
composes the proven pieces of the soundness layer —

* `extract_correct` — the IPA extractor recovers the witness from an accepting transcript tree;
* `commitGen_round` — folding preserves the commitment (so an accepting transcript yields a
  consistent tree); opening uniqueness holds up to a computed discrete-log relation
  (`NontrivialDLRelation.ofIpaOpenings`);
* `quotientCheck_sound` + `Expr.eval_toPoly` — the verifier's gate check, via Schwartz–Zippel, forces the
  committed polynomials to satisfy the circuit's constraint identity (off a `≤ d/p` bad set).

`SnarkRelation` is the relation the SNARK proves (the witness opens the commitment and the committed
polynomials satisfy the constraint identity); `knowledge_sound` assembles the proven lemmas into "the
extractor recovers a witness satisfying the relation, unique up to a computed discrete-log
relation"; `soundness_error` is the residual `≤ d/p` Schwartz–Zippel error.

## Assumptions

This layer is sound relative to the following, each kept explicit rather than hidden:

* **DLR hardness** (discrete-log relations on the Vesta generators) — consumed only at the
  computational layer: a second distinct opening yields a computed nontrivial relation
  (`NontrivialDLRelation.ofIpaOpenings`), the object the hardness assumption forbids an
  efficient adversary to produce.
* **Fiat–Shamir / Blake2b** as a random oracle — challenges are treated as uniform and unpredictable; the
  hash and the random-oracle reduction are not modeled. The capstone's current assumption
  (`ExtractableFromAcceptance`) is in fact stronger — it bundles the IPA knowledge-soundness conclusion,
  not just Fiat–Shamir; narrowing it to "uniform challenges" is open extraction-side work.
* **Vesta group order** — the abstract development runs over any `Fp`-module `G`;
  `Zcash.Snark.Soundness.Vesta` pins it to the concrete Vesta curve, whose group order is proven
  with no assumption (`vestaOrder`, from CompElliptic's `Pasta.Vesta.card_eq`).
* **VK-correctness** (Daira's flow) — that the VK's gates encode the intended high-level relation (note
  ownership, value balance, nullifiers) is a separate workstream; this layer proves the verifier sound
  relative to the given VK, ending at "the witness satisfies the VK's constraint system."

## For human review
Check that `SnarkRelation` is the intended relation, that the four assumptions above are the right ones
and acceptably standard, and that the captured fingerprint match (`Zcash.Snark.Fixture`) is for the
intended Orchard Action circuit.

-- Tracked decode gap: the two conjuncts of `SnarkRelation` share only the symbol `a`.

-- at all. Binding the decode to `a` — via the proven but currently unused `batch_open_soundV` —
-- is exactly what closes it.
/-- The relation the SNARK proves: the witness `a` opens the commitment `P` to the value `v`
(`IpaRelation`) and satisfies the circuit (`circuitSat a`) — both conjuncts about the *same*
extracted witness. `circuitSat`'s intended instantiation is `circuitSatViaGates` ("the witness's
decoded columns satisfy the `y`-combined gates"); see the tracked decode gap above. -/

to a computed discrete-log relation: a second distinct opening yields
`NontrivialDLRelation.ofIpaOpenings`. `hcons` and `hsat` are assumed, not derived from
acceptance; deriving them (`accepting_fold_eq`, `constraint_identity_of_accept`) is open
composition work. -/
