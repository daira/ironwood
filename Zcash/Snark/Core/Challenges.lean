# The verifier's challenges

The fingerprint MSM's coefficients are assembled from the proof's evaluation scalars and the
verifier's challenges; this module records the challenges: `θ, β, γ, y, x` (the main verifier),
`x₁…x₄` (the multiopen), and `ξ, z` plus the `k` round challenges `uⱼ` (the IPA opening).

We do not model the transcript. How the challenges are derived — Fiat–Shamir over a Blake2b hash
of the proof so far — is hand-waved (project scope; the deployed non-interactive derivation is
related to the interactive verifier separately). All the fingerprint needs is that the challenges
are the verifier's randomness: free `F_p` variables the soundness argument (Schwartz–Zippel,
special soundness) quantifies over.

/-- The verifier's challenges, over a field carrier `F`, in squeeze order.

From the main verifier: `theta` (keeps the lookup columns linearly independent), `beta`, `gamma`,
`y` (keeps the gates linearly independent), and `x` (the evaluation point). From the multiopen:
`x1` (compresses same-point-set openings), `x2` (keeps the multi-point quotient terms independent),
`x3` (the opening point), and `x4` (collapses the remaining openings). From the IPA opening: `xi`
(blinds it), `z` (binds the inner product to the generator `u`), and the `k` round challenges
`ipaRound`. -/
