# Concrete certificate for the derived Action verifying key

This module contains the expensive concrete computation, separately from the reusable
derivation data: ONE bundled `native_decide` comparing every field of the derived
verifying key against the capture — the Lagrange-prefix cross-check and the two
commitment families (the group-side cost), plus the scalar/gate/layout fields and the
derived `Shape` (CS-scale).

EVALUATION-SHARING DISCIPLINE (each rule was measured, the hard way):
* The commitment passes use the SEQUENTIAL cores (`fixedCommitmentsSeqWith`/
  `permutationCommitmentsSeqWith`): nullary-definition sharing does NOT survive a
  `parMap` task fan-out in this evaluation tier — the 44 column tasks each captured
  the unforced shared-basis thunk and re-ran the whole basis derivation (44 × ~4 min =
  the CPU-hours regression this replaces). Let-binding the basis inside the decided
  proposition shares correctly at evaluation but blows the elaborator's fixed budget
  at proof-term finalization; the sequential map costs only ~26 s (scatter committer,
  0.6 s/column) and keeps both evaluation and finalization on known-good mechanisms.
* There is NO GROUP FFT. `commitLagrangeSpec_derivedUrsGLagrange` (MSM bilinearity applied
  to `bestFftG_dft`) moves the inverse transform off the curve and onto the coefficients:
  each column is inverse-DFT'd as SCALARS and then committed against the MONOMIAL URS. The
  scalar transform is the same `bestFftG` at `G := Fp`, run on the Montgomery lane
  (`Fast.invDftScalarsMontWith`, `ScalarMont.fft`); the 2048-point group FFT it replaces was
  measured at 206.8 s of the module's former 258 s. The 10-generator Lagrange prefix the
  bundle cross-checks is likewise 10 monomial MSMs of the closed coefficient rows
  (`Fast.take_derivedUrsGLagrange_montPre`), not a prefix of an FFT output — otherwise the
  group FFT would still be forced.
* The basis and the per-column committer run through the MONTGOMERY LANE
  (`Fast.msmMontPre` / `Fast.commitInvDftMontWith`): the zero-import `ProjectiveMontDefs`
  and `ScalarFftDefs` twins over the eight-limb Montgomery field, proven equal to the
  statement-surface functions via the kernel simulation theorems (`msmM_spec`, `fftS_spec`)
  — which ride in turn on the field's ring isomorphism, so the certificate's group work runs
  on a PROVEN field implementation rather than on `%`-reduced `Nat`s.
  Both twins are natively compiled, by two `precompileModules` leaves: the CompElliptic pin's
  own `FastFieldNative` carries the field and the projective kernels, ironwood's
  `Zcash.FastFieldNative` carries the scalar FFT.
  The monomial basis in Montgomery form (`monomialBasis`), the twiddle table and the `n⁻¹`
  scale are nullary shares: the coordinate conversion and the 1024 root powers happen once
  per process, not once per column.
  Profiling note: THIS module gets both dylibs automatically (the `ZcashKeygen` lib
  reaches the lanes, so lake passes `--load-dynlib` for each); a SCRATCH probe through
  `lake env lean` does NOT, and must pass
  `--load-dynlib=.lake/packages/CompElliptic/.lake/build/lib/libCompElliptic_FastFieldNative.so`
  and `--load-dynlib=.lake/build/lib/libZcash_Zcash_FastFieldNative.so` explicitly or it
  measures the interpreted tier.
* `actionPinned` stays a nullary share: it is only touched from the main evaluation
  thread, where nullary init-once sharing does hold (the `VkMatch` fix).

The `Decidable` instance for the bundle is CONSTRUCTED leaf-by-leaf (`bundleDecEq`):
instance search on products mixing the `Fp`-typed scalars with the group-element
lists spins out in the `Fp` reducibility diamond, while every leaf synthesizes
instantly. `vk_eq_derived`/`vk_eq_toVerifierKey` assemble the record equality by
`simp only` unfolding of the named definitions on both sides until the spellings
coincide — no defeq bridges.

The `ZcashKeygen` target builds this module explicitly; ordinary clients of
`derivedActionVk` only need `Derivation`.
