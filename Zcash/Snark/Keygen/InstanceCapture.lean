# The captured instance commitments are the circuit-derived ones

The Action model uses the *circuit-derived* public-instance family
`actionCircuit.instanceCommitment actionProofParams capturedURS inputs` — commitments computed
from the public inputs, as halo2's `verify_proof` computes them from its `instances` argument. The
captured artifacts, meanwhile, are exercised
against the fixture's own family `Fixture.derivedInstanceCommitment` (the Fiat–Shamir fingerprint,
`assemble?`, the negative tests), which `instance_commitments_derived` pins to the captured points
`capturedInstanceCommitments` (ironwood#65/#85).

Nothing joined those two families, so the circuit model could not be instantiated at the captured
proof — the last open seam in sound handling of public instances (ironwood#86). This module closes it.

Two steps, and the first carries the weight:

* **The bases agree.** Halo2 commits public inputs against the Lagrange generators
  (`Fixture.commitLagrange`, `Params::commit_lagrange` under `Blind::default () = 1`), while the
  extractor works against the monomial URS. `commitLagrange_eq_commitInstance` identifies the
  captured computation with the abstract `LagrangeCommitmentKey.commitInstance` at `capturedURS`.
  It needs no new fixture check: the captured Lagrange prefix is already certified against the
  monomial derivation by `derivedUrsGLagrange_prefix_eq`, and `LagrangeCommitmentKey` is a
  subsingleton, so the key a downstream statement names is the key the certificate discharges.
* **The rows agree.** `capturedActionInputs` reads the captured public instances back as the
  circuit's own `PublicInputs` record, and `publicInputRows_capturedActionInputs` checks that the
  circuit's public-input serialization reproduces the captured column. That check is the only
  `native_decide` here, and it is a statement about ten field elements.

(`capturedPublicInstances_within_lagrange`).

The key is universally quantified because `LagrangeCommitmentKey` records no choice: this discharges
the identity against whichever key a downstream statement names, once its domain generator is
recognised as the captured one. -/
