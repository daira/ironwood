# The bundle-level Action-to-ledger bridge

Lift the per-Action data bridge across an accepted bundle.  Each extracted member
witness (`TopLevelSemanticWitness`) is a satisfying witness of the circuit-facing
`ActionSpec` (`Zcash.Common.Satisfying`), and `actionSpecToLedgerData` refines it to
the member's ledger data —the full extracted witness together with its refined
ledger action— or the computed discrete-log relation of its first Sinsemilla
escape.  The bundle traversal returns every member's data or the first escape
(`finForallOrRelationWitness`): knowledge soundness composed at the reduction layer,
with everything carried as data.
