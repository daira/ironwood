# Framework-Leakage Audit — Clean/Ironwood

**Anchor commit:** `4d922b1a` (branch `halo2-clean-2`). All line numbers are from that
tree — re-grep the symbol name before trusting a line number.

This is a standalone handoff for a cleanup agent with **no other context**. Read the
"Design contract" and "Rules" sections first, then work the "Cleanup order".

**No builds while surveying** was the rule that produced this doc; the cleanup agent
*will* need to build. Every claimed generic lemma below has been read in the framework
sources and exists at the cited location unless flagged "NEW".

---

## Design contract (what "leakage" means here)

`Clean/Halo2/` is the **framework**: the circuit monad, the `FormalCircuit` /
`FormalRegionCircuit` bundles, the `circuit_norm` simp set, `subcircuit_rw`, and the
`circuit_proof_start` proof-prefix tactic. `Clean/Ironwood/` is **userland**: ported
gadgets and their proofs. **The ideal (maintainer ruling, 2026-07-20): a gadget file
reasons about the framework through `circuit_proof_start` and the `circuit_norm` simp set
— and nothing else.** One tactic pass should remove ALL framework material (eval
statements, chunk shapes, accessor spellings), leaving a pure domain-level goal. Even
hand-invoking a *named* framework lemma in a gadget proof is a smell: it marks a
tactic/simp-set gap to be fixed centrally, not a sanctioned usage tier. A fortiori, any
lemma in a gadget file whose *statement* is an instance of a generic framework fact about
`.call` / `.output` / `.operations` / `.regionCount` / `ExtendsWitnesses` / `Constraints`
of a bundle the gadget did not define is a **defect** — "framework-first, never userland
scaffolding". The named-lemma inventory below is therefore the *repair toolkit* for the
cleanup (rewriting workarounds into their honest form), not the end state; the end state
is those lemmas firing inside `circuit_norm`/`circuit_proof_start` where gadgets never
spell them.

The framework already ships the generic replacements for most of what follows
(`Clean/Halo2/Subcircuit.lean`):

- `FormalCircuit.call_regionCount` (L167) + `.call_regionCount'` (L176, concrete-α)
- `FormalCircuit.output_call` (L56) + `.output_call'` (L115, `@[circuit_norm]`)
- `FormalCircuit.nextRegionIndex_call` (L96) + `.nextRegionIndex_call'` (L143)
- `FormalRegionCircuit.toFormal_call_extendsWitnesses` (L127) — the witness-bridge precedent
- `FormalCircuit.foldOps_regionCount / foldOps_constraints / foldOps_extendsWitnesses /
  foldCall_output / foldCall_operations / foldCall_nextRegionIndex` (L219–303) — the
  serial-fold API
- `FormalCircuit.callOps_eq` (`Formal.lean` L318) / `call_operations` (L328)

and the **`derive_contract_bridges name (binders)* := <bundle>`** command
(`Clean/Halo2/Tactics/ContractBridges.lean`, namespace `Halo2.lns`) which auto-generates a
child's `_spec_eq` / `_extract_eq` / `_output` / `_regionCount` / `_nextRegionIndex`
rfl-bridges from the bundle term. `circuit_proof_start` runs this on-the-fly internally.
See `Clean/Halo2/Tests/TestContractBridges.lean` for the pinned output shape.

---

## Executive summary

    Clean/Ironwood carries ~900 framework-plumbing sites across ~25 gadget files,
    roughly 1500–2000 LOC that re-implement framework facts in userland. The three
    biggest families are: (1) ~120 per-child accessor/bridge lemmas — *_call_regionCount
    / *_spec_eq / *_extract_eq / *_output / *_call_output / *_call_witnesses — each
    re-proving a generic FormalCircuit.call_* fact or an rfl-projection that the
    `derive_contract_bridges` command already auto-generates; (2) 314 `with_unfolding_all`
    call sites (164 in Action/Bundle.lean alone) plus ~169 bare `… from rfl` /
    `:= by rfl` defeq bridges that cross the call-spelling↔metadata-spelling boundary the
    framework should reconcile via named lemmas; (3) hand-rolled bundle bookkeeping —
    ~40 `synth*_regionCount` / `_nextRegionIndex` / `_output` lemmas and their `rw`
    chains that manually crack open child chunks that `subcircuit_rw` / the fold API
    should consume. The epicenter is Action/Bundle.lean (28 bridge lemmas, 164 unfoldings,
    four `set_option maxRecDepth 8192` bumps); the Sinsemilla and NoteCommit/CommitIvk
    bundle files are the next tier. None of this is unsound — it is duplication and
    boundary-crossing that a handful of framework additions plus `derive_contract_bridges`
    adoption would delete wholesale.

---

## Category 1 — Per-child accessor / bridge lemmas (the largest family)

Each of these is a `private theorem <child>_call_<field>` (or `_spec_eq` / `_extract_eq` /
`_output`) whose body is a one-line `rw [FormalCircuit.call_regionCount]; rfl`, a
`FormalRegionCircuit.toFormal_call_extendsWitnesses _ …`, or a bare `:= rfl`. They bake a
concrete numeric region-count / output tuple / spec restatement into a named lemma so the
gadget's bundle-completeness proof can `rw` it. **This is exactly the output of
`derive_contract_bridges`.**

### 1a. `*_call_regionCount` spelling-wrappers (≈28 defs)

Body is uniformly `rw [FormalCircuit.call_regionCount]; rfl` (or `.foldOps_regionCount`).

| File | Line | Name | RC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Action/Bundle.lean | 27 | `toFormal_call_regionCount` (generic-over-bundle copy) | =1 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 35 | `wpoint_call_regionCount` | =1 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 42 | `wpointNonId_call_regionCount` | =1 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 49 | `merkle_call_regionCount` | =128 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 61 | `vc_call_regionCount` | =5 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 70 | `dn_call_regionCount` | =9 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 79 | `sa_call_regionCount` | =3 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 87 | `civk_call_regionCount` | =14 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 96 | `ai_call_regionCount` | =6 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 104 | `nc_call_regionCount` | =43 |
| Action/Bundle.lean | 1954 | `base_call_regionCount` | (mainPost) |
| CommitIvk/Main.lean | 153 | `commit_call_regionCount` | |
| CommitIvk/Main.lean | 163 | `composite_call_regionCount` | |
| DeriveNullifier.lean | 107 | `hash_call_regionCount` | |
| DeriveNullifier.lean | 116 | `addChip_call_regionCount` | |
| DeriveNullifier.lean | 124 | `bfe_call_regionCount` | |
| ValueCommit.lean | 58 | `short_call_regionCount` | |
| NoteCommit/Main.lean | 337 | `toFormal_call_regionCount` | |
| NoteCommit/Main.lean | 346 | `yc_call_regionCount` | |
| NoteCommit/Main.lean | 355 | `commit_call_regionCount` | |
| NoteCommit/MainBundle.lean | 74 | `yc_call_regionCount` | |
| NoteCommit/MainBundle.lean | 82 | `commit_call_regionCount` | |
| NoteCommit/MainBundle.lean | 169 | `toFormal_call_regionCount` | |
| CommitDomain.lean | 151 | `blind_call_regionCount` | |
| Ecc/Mul.lean | 1834 | `mul_call_regionCount` | |
| Ecc/Add.lean | 414 | `toFormal_call_regionCount` | |
| Ecc/WitnessPoint.lean | 176 | `pointNonId_toFormal_call_regionCount` | |
| Ecc/MulFixed/FullWidth.lean | 1118 | `circuit_call_regionCount` | |

Note the **cross-file duplication**: `toFormal_call_regionCount` (the generic
`FormalRegionCircuit.toFormal … = 1` wrapper) is copy-pasted verbatim in Action/Bundle
(27), NoteCommit/Main (337), NoteCommit/MainBundle (169). Likewise
`yc_call_regionCount` / `commit_call_regionCount` are duplicated between NoteCommit/Main
and NoteCommit/MainBundle. (See Category 2.)

### 1b. `*_spec_eq` restatements (55 defs) and `*_extract_eq` (26 defs)

Uniformly `:= rfl` (or a 2-line simp). Representative: `Ecc/Mul.lean:1821
mul_spec_eq : mul.Spec = … := rfl`; `YComposite.lean:269 gateChild_extract_eq … := rfl`;
`Action/Bundle.lean:368–516` (a wall of `toFormal_spec_eq`, `wpoint_spec_eq`,
`merkle_spec_eq`, `vc_spec_eq`, `dn_spec_eq`, `sa_spec_eq`, `civk_spec_eq`, `ai_spec_eq`,
`nc_spec_eq`, plus the matching `*_extract_eq`). Full def-site list (grep
`theorem \w+_spec_eq` / `_extract_eq`): Poseidon/Permute (fullRound/partialRound),
Poseidon/Hash (initRegion/addInputRegion/permuteRegion), all five NoteCommit/Composites
`gateChild_spec_eq`, CommitIvk/{MainBundle,Composite}, Sinsemilla/{Chain,Merkle,CommitDomain,
HashToPoint}, MulOverflow, MulFixed/FullWidth. These are **precisely `derive_contract_bridges`
output** — every one should be deleted and replaced by a single
`derive_contract_bridges <child> := <bundle-term>` invocation per bundle.

### 1c. `*_call_output` / `*_output_eq` output-bridges (10 defs)

| File | Line | Name |
|---|---|---|
| Ecc/Mul.lean | 393 | `incomplete_call_output` |
| Ecc/Mul.lean | 404 | `complete_call_output_zs` |
| Ecc/Mul.lean | 411 | `add_call_output` |
| Ecc/Mul.lean | 473/491/504 | plain-`.output` restatements of the above |
| Sinsemilla/HashToPoint.lean | 461 | `hashCircuit_output_eq` |
| Poseidon/Permute.lean | 64/68 | `fullRound_output_eq` / `partialRound_output_eq` |

Mul.lean's `private *_call_output` family is the exemplar the task brief already flagged
as a defect pattern. These bridge the `call`-spelling of `.output` to the metadata
spelling; the generic `FormalCircuit.output_call'` (`@[circuit_norm]`) plus
`derive_contract_bridges`'s `_output` bridge subsumes them.

### 1d. `*_call_witnesses` (1 remaining)

| File | Line | Name |
|---|---|---|
| NoteCommit/YComposite.lean | 259 | `gateChild_call_witnesses` (**already** `:= FormalRegionCircuit.toFormal_call_extendsWitnesses _ …`) |

This one *already* delegates to the generic framework lemma — so it is a thin public
re-export, not a re-proof. Keep it only if a downstream file (MainBundle.lean:739 rewrites
`YCanonicityCheck.gateChild_call_witnesses`) genuinely needs the specialized statement;
otherwise inline the generic lemma at the two use sites. The three `toFormal_call_witnesses`
copies and the `wpoint_call_witnesses` / `wpointNonId_call_witnesses` family the brief
mentions have **already been deleted** in favor of the generic lemma — YComposite is the
last survivor.

**GENERIC FIX for all of Category 1:** adopt `derive_contract_bridges <child> := <bundle>`
(one command per child bundle) to auto-generate the `_spec_eq / _extract_eq / _output /
_regionCount / _nextRegionIndex` bridges; delete the hand-written ones. For the pure
`_call_regionCount` numeric wrappers, either use the generated `_regionCount` bridge or
inline `FormalCircuit.call_regionCount` (concrete-α: `.call_regionCount'`) + `rfl` at the
call site.

**Blocker to note (task #34):** `derive_contract_bridges` currently does NOT handle
**function-typed binders**, which is why the `chainC_*` / `hashC_*` / `shortC_*` bridge
stacks in HashToPoint / CommitDomain / Merkle are still hand-written (their bundle terms
take `ℕ → …` witness-generator arguments). Extending the command to function-typed binders
(task #34) collapses those stacks.

**Migration recipe:** for each `<child>` bundle in a file, (1) add
`derive_contract_bridges <child> := <bundle-term-with-binders>` near the bundle def;
(2) build; (3) `grep` the file for the old hand-written `<child>_spec_eq` etc., delete each
and let the generated name take over (names match by convention — verify against
TestContractBridges.lean); (4) rebuild. Do one child at a time to keep the diff bisectable.

---

## Category 2 — Cross-file duplicate lemmas (α-equivalent, different names)

Same statement proved in ≥2 files:

| Statement | Sites |
|---|---|
| generic `FormalRegionCircuit.toFormal … regionCount = 1` | Action/Bundle:27, NoteCommit/Main:337, NoteCommit/MainBundle:169, (and the true generic is already `FormalCircuit.call_regionCount`) |
| `yc_call_regionCount` | NoteCommit/Main:346, NoteCommit/MainBundle:74 |
| `commit_call_regionCount` | NoteCommit/Main:355, NoteCommit/MainBundle:82, CommitIvk/Main:153 |
| `short_spec_eq` / `short_output` | CommitIvk/MainBundle:26/40, NoteCommit/MainBundle:28, YComposite:104, ValueCommit:41 |
| `rangeCheckAt_spec_eq` | YComposite:34, NoteCommit/Composites:37, CommitIvk/Composite:33, NoteCommit/MainBundle:49 |
| `gateChild_spec_eq` | 4× in NoteCommit/Composites (107/282/439/597), YComposite:229, CommitIvk/Composite:141 |
| `short_extract_eq'` | NoteCommit/MainBundle:558, CommitIvk/MainBundle:466 |

**GENERIC FIX:** the `toFormal_*_regionCount` = 1 copies are all instances of
`FormalCircuit.call_regionCount` + `rfl`; delete and inline. The rest are
`derive_contract_bridges` output (Category 1b) that happens to be duplicated because each
bundle file re-derives its shared children — once the command is adopted, either the
generated bridges live once in the child's own file and are imported, or each file
generates its own (cheap, rfl) copy and the duplication is invisible boilerplate rather
than hand-maintained code. Prefer: generate the bridge **in the child's defining file**
and import.

---

## Category 3 — Defeq hacks crossing the framework boundary

Two shapes. Both mean "the tactic pipeline (`circuit_proof_start`/`circuit_norm`) did not
reconcile these two spellings for me, so I forced kernel defeq." The repair adds the
missing rewrite to the framework simp set / tactic pass — after which the gadget proof
should not need to spell anything at all — not a hand-cited lemma at each site.

### 3a. `with_unfolding_all` (314 sites)

| File | count | | File | count |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Action/Bundle.lean | 164 | | Ecc/MulComplete.lean | 12 |
| NoteCommit/MainBundle.lean | 28 | | Action/AddressIntegrity.lean | 9 |
| Sinsemilla/Merkle.lean | 26 | | Ecc/Mul.lean | 8 |
| CommitIvk/MainBundle.lean | 17 | | Ecc/MulIncomplete.lean | 8 |
| Sinsemilla/Chain.lean | 12 | | NoteCommit/Main.lean | 7 |
| (others: CommitDomain 6, HashToPoint 3, Basic 3, HashPiece 2, Permute 2, Hash 2, CommitIvk/Main 2, WitnessPoint 1, CommitIvk/Bundle 1, DeriveNullifier 1) | | | | |

Most are `by with_unfolding_all rfl` (a spelling bridge) or
`by with_unfolding_all exact h<...>` (re-typing a hypothesis whose type differs only by an
unfolded `.output` / `eval` / `Point.x` spelling). Action/Bundle is the epicenter — the
`main` soundness/completeness proofs re-type dozens of child-output hypotheses this way.

### 3b. bare `… from rfl` / `:= by rfl` / `show … from rfl` (≈169 sites)

Representative: `Sinsemilla/Merkle.lean:1121 show cfg.1.sinsemilla.xA … from rfl`;
`HashToPoint.lean:191/207 show (… : Value (Output k) Fp) from by with_unfolding_all rfl`.
These assert a `call`-spelling term equals a metadata/`eval`-literal spelling by kernel
defeq inside a larger `rw`/`simp`.

**GENERIC FIX:** these are the symptom the concrete-α restatements
(`output_call'`, `call_regionCount'`, `nextRegionIndex_call'`) and `subcircuit_rw` exist to
kill — a proof that needs `with_unfolding_all rfl` to bridge `(child.call cfg inp).output i`
to the child's `extract` tuple is missing the `@[circuit_norm]` `output_call'` rewrite in
its `simp` set. **Recommended framework work:** audit which spellings still force
`with_unfolding_all` (start with Action/Bundle's `main` proof), and add the missing
concrete-α `@[circuit_norm]` restatement or a `subcircuit_rw` extension so the proof closes
with `simp only [circuit_norm]` / `subcircuit_rw` instead of raw defeq. Each such addition
deletes a cluster of `with_unfolding_all` sites. Treat a `with_unfolding_all` in a gadget
proof as a **framework bug report**, not an acceptable idiom.

**Migration recipe:** per file, for each `with_unfolding_all rfl` / `from rfl`, identify the
two spellings; find (or add) the framework lemma reconciling them; replace with a named
`rw`/`simp only`. Where the spelling is a bundle `.output`/`.extract`, the fix is almost
always the `derive_contract_bridges`-generated `_output`/`_extract_eq` bridge from
Category 1.

---

## Category 4 — Hand-rolled simp sets unfolding framework internals

Gadget proofs that manually `simp only [FormalCircuit.call, FormalCircuit.callOps_eq,
Circuit.operations, …]` to crack open a call chunk the engine should consume:

| File | Line | Args |
|---|---|---|
| NoteCommit/MainBundle.lean | 732 | `simp only [FormalCircuit.call, FormalCircuit.callOps_eq, Circuit.operations]` |
| CommitIvk/MainBundle.lean | 557 | `simp only [FormalCircuit.call, FormalCircuit.callOps_eq, Circuit.operations]` |

Plus ~85 sites across Ironwood where a `simp`/`rw` arg is one of `FormalCircuit.call`,
`callOps_eq`, `Circuit.operations`, `RegionCircuit.operations`, `ExtendsWitnesses`,
`Halo2.Constraints`, `assignRegion` (grep those tokens). The concentrated offenders are the
`*Bundle.lean` completeness proofs and Sinsemilla/{Chain,Merkle,HashToPoint} `.output`
extractions (`ElaboratedRegionCircuit.output_eq` + `RegionCircuit.output_bind/pure` +
`output_assignAdvice` chains, e.g. HashToPoint:287–294, Chain:1177–1184, Merkle:1121–1124).

**GENERIC FIX:** these manual chunk-cracks are what `subcircuit_rw` (soundness/completeness
chunk rewriter) and `FormalCircuit.foldOps_constraints/extendsWitnesses` (for loop bodies)
are for. Where a proof reaches for `callOps_eq` + `Circuit.operations` by hand, it should be
one `subcircuit_rw` call. The `ElaboratedRegionCircuit.output_eq` + `output_bind/pure`
extraction chains in Sinsemilla want a named framework lemma
"`<bundle>.output = <extract tuple>`" — again the `derive_contract_bridges` `_output`
bridge. **Recommended framework work:** confirm `subcircuit_rw` covers the two
`callOps_eq` sites (they may predate it), and add an `output`-extraction lemma/`circuit_norm`
entry for the RegionCircuit `.output` walk so Sinsemilla stops hand-unfolding.

---

## Category 5 — Bundle bookkeeping families (classify: keep vs delete)

Per-bundle `synth*_regionCount` / `_nextRegionIndex` / `_output` lemmas (~40 defs total,
grep `theorem \w+_regionCount` = 60 incl. Category 1a; `_nextRegionIndex` = 6;
`theorem \w+_output` = 41).

**KEEP (private metadata helpers — NOT exports):** the *composite* lemmas that define a
bundle's own `ElaboratedCircuit` metadata fields — consumed by
`regionCount_eq := fun input i => (synth_regionCount …).symm` etc. Maintainer ruling
(2026-07-20): these are tolerated only as `private` helpers with that single consumer;
anything a parent needs must flow through the framework's subcircuit composition, never
through a child-exported lemma. A reference to one of these outside its own `elaborated`
instance is a finding (metadata field bypassed). Examples: `synth_regionCount` in
NoteCommit/Composites (4×), CommitIvk/Composite:132, YComposite:287, Poseidon/Hash:143,
MulOverflow:277, all the `synthesize_regionCount` in MulFixed/{Short,BaseFieldElem,FullWidth};
`main_regionCount`/`mainPost_regionCount`/`synthesize_regionCount`/`synthWitness_regionCount`/
`synthChecks_regionCount`/`synthNotes_regionCount` in Action/Bundle; `synthPieces_*` /
`synthChecks_*` / `synthGates_*` in NoteCommit/Main + CommitIvk/Main. These are correct
altitude.

**DELETE (redundant re-derivations / spelling dups):** the per-*child* `*_call_regionCount`
wrappers folded into Category 1a, and the copy-paste of a composite lemma across bundle
files (Category 2). Also review `currentRegion_nextRegionIndex`
(NoteCommit/Main:198) — likely a generic `RegionIndex` identity that belongs in the
framework.

**GENERIC FIX:** none needed for the keepers. For the deletables, see Categories 1–2. The
composite `synth*_regionCount` proofs themselves contain long
`rw [<child>_call_regionCount, <child>_call_regionCount, …]` chains (e.g.
NoteCommit/Main:389–392 rewrites `toFormal_call_regionCount` nine times; Action/Bundle:119,
128, 138 chains) — once the child bridges are `derive_contract_bridges`-generated, these
chains stay but reference generated names; they cannot be auto-collapsed without a
`regionCount`-computing tactic (optional future work: a `bundle_regionCount` tactic that
sums child `.regionCount` via the fold API).

---

## Category 6 — Tactic-workaround scaffolding



`set_option maxRecDepth` bumps **in gadget proof files** (excluding data-heavy
Fixtures/*.lean and Ecc/MulFixed/Certs/*.lean, whose 100000 bumps are legitimate concrete
layout/cert evaluation):

| File | Lines | Value | Likely cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| Action/Bundle.lean | 749, 1215, 2028, 2102 | 8192 | `main` sound/complete over 15 children; deep call-chunk nesting |
| CommitIvk/MainBundle.lean | 222, 591 | 4096 | bundle completeness |
| CommitIvk/Composite.lean | 173 | 4096 | |
| NoteCommit/YComposite.lean | 297 | 4096 | `synth_regionCount` chunk unfold |

These bumps correlate 1:1 with the files that hand-unfold call chunks (Category 4) and
re-type via `with_unfolding_all` (Category 3): the recursion depth is spent in kernel defeq
that a named `simp only [circuit_norm]` / `subcircuit_rw` path would not incur. Expect the
bumps to become unnecessary (or droppable to the default) once Categories 3–4 are fixed in
that file. **Do not** add new `maxRecDepth` bumps to gadget files (per repo memory: "No
huge maxHeartbeats — prefer a framework fix").

Also in this category: the recorded **tactic gaps** in Sinsemilla/Chain.lean:1083–1093
(`circuit_proof_start`'s step-(b) peel times out at whnf on the slot bundle — the proof
falls back to manual `ElaboratedRegionCircuit.output_eq` unfolding). This is a
`circuit_proof_start` / `subcircuit_rw` capability gap on function-family-indexed bundles;
fixing it removes the manual fallback in Chain and likely the parallel ones in
Merkle/HashToPoint.

**Baseline for contrast:** 135 healthy `circuit_proof_start` invocations across Ironwood —
the tactic works for the vast majority of gadgets. The scaffolding above is concentrated in
the ~6 large *bundle-composition* files where the engine hits its current limits.

---

## Cleanup order (dependency-ordered — framework additions unlock deletions)

1. **Extend `derive_contract_bridges` to function-typed binders (task #34).** Unlocks
   deleting the `chainC_*` / `hashC_*` / `shortC_*` bridge stacks in HashToPoint /
   CommitDomain / Merkle (Category 1b, the function-family bundles). Framework-only change;
   pin new output in TestContractBridges.lean.

2. **Adopt `derive_contract_bridges` for all fixed-binder child bundles.** Delete the
   hand-written `_spec_eq` / `_extract_eq` / `_output` / numeric `_call_regionCount` bridges
   (Categories 1a/1b/1c, 2). Do it file-by-file, child-by-child; each is an independent,
   bisectable diff. Start with the leaf gadgets (Ecc/Add, WitnessPoint, MulFixed/FullWidth,
   DeriveNullifier children) before the composite bundles (Action/Bundle, NoteCommit,
   CommitIvk) so the composites' `rw [<child>_bridge]` chains flip to generated names last.

3. **Add the missing concrete-α `@[circuit_norm]` restatements / `subcircuit_rw` coverage**
   for the spellings currently bridged by `with_unfolding_all` and hand `callOps_eq`
   (Categories 3, 4). Prioritize by count: Action/Bundle (164) → NoteCommit/MainBundle (28)
   → Merkle (26) → CommitIvk/MainBundle (17) → Chain (12) / MulComplete (12). Each framework
   lemma added deletes a cluster; re-grep `with_unfolding_all` after each to measure.

4. **Fix the `circuit_proof_start` / `subcircuit_rw` whnf-timeout on function-family
   bundles** (Chain:1083 gap). Removes the manual `output_eq` fallbacks in Chain / Merkle /
   HashToPoint.
   **ROOT-CAUSED (H, 2026-07-21, scratch repro on Chain's bundle):** the Chain:1055
   "engine wall" comment is STALE — plain cps now completes the whole prefix in ~2.5k
   heartbeats (per-slot ∀-facts split, gate facts landed). The one remaining burn is
   `h_output`: mixing `ElaboratedRegionCircuit.output_eq` into a full `circuit_norm`
   simp at `h_output` times out (>9 min; diagnostics: 207k `Eq.rec`/111k `List.rec`
   unfolds — the capped struct-eval simprocs + `Circuit.bind_def` unification retries
   traverse the un-shrunk loop innards at every subterm, and the caps only bound each
   attempt, not the sum). The narrow ladder (`output_eq` + `output_bind`/`output_pure`
   + leaf `output_*`) is instant — beta drops the loop body wholesale. PARTIAL FIX APPLIED (post-d9ae53a5): cps gained a
   CONDITIONAL rescue hook at `h_output` (`rescueFoldedOutput`, fires only when the main
   peel leaves `Elaborated*.output` FOLDED) — but it currently FAILS CLOSED corpus-wide:
   `simp only [<instance const>]` does not rewrite an instance-def occurrence (`unfold`
   does). Switching it to `unfold` is pending a KERNEL-cost audit: the structural output
   reduction elaborates instantly (verified in scratch: unfold + output_bind/pure lands
   Chain's h_output on the small cell record in ms), but the produced rfl-steps hand the
   kernel an uncapped defeq over the loop-composed term — a scratch decl with that route
   + a follow-up full `circuit_norm at h_output` hangs past 8 min WALL with simp capped
   at 100k heartbeats, i.e. the cost is in kernel checking, not elaboration. Chain's
   manual ladder (narrow rw + targeted simps, Chain:1151) is the kernel-friendly
   spelling; subsuming it into the rescue = the Chain port task.
   **RESCUE PARKED (H, end of second wave):** wiring the working unfold-of-instance
   rescue into `run` (tried at two pipeline positions) conflicts with the
   abstracted-outputs regime — proofs consuming outputs via `x_gen_out_*`/`h_gen_out_*`
   (BaseFieldElem inner families) break when h_output reduces under them, and on
   85-window loop families the structural pass is itself an 85-unroll that blows
   heartbeat budgets (BFE:848). The mechanics stay in `rescueFoldedOutput` (unwired)
   with the full analysis; next design: per-proof opt-in via a cps argument, or a
   cost-bounded reduction. The 4 Chain/HashToPoint manual ladders stay for now.
   Designs REJECTED en
   route (both regressed green files before the conditional fail-closed form): an
   unconditional structural pre-pass (changed 4 files' destructure shapes) and an
   `output_eq`-first rescue (sends explicit-output instances down the structural route,
   broke the MulFixed trio's `change` ladders).
    Expected fallout: the manual `output_eq` ladders in Chain (1151, 1465) and
   HashToPoint (265, 346) go dead → delete; `hPS`/`hIS`-named ladders are untouched.
   **FullWidth outer-peel ALSO root-caused (H, same session, scratch repro):** the
   "cps deep-recurses on the 85-window synthesize" comment is imprecise — steps (a)–(e′)
   all complete in ~1.5k heartbeats (innerRegion's `seal` holds through the peel; the
   auto-unfold's equation for it never fires). The killer is step (f) rowFactChaining's
   `simp only [h_input, h_output] at hc ⊢`: matching h_output's LHS (which spells
   `(innerRegion …).output i₀` inside the add-call record) forces isDefEq through the
   sealed 85-window body — >512 recursion depth (Prod.rec nest). The step IS
   `try`-guarded, but Lean's tactic `try` RETHROWS runtime exceptions (maxRecDepth), so
   the guard is porous and cps dies instead of degrading. FIX APPLIED (same batch): a
   `bestEffort` wrapper for cps's guarded steps — `Core.withCatchingRuntimeEx` +
   saved-state restore, catching depth/stack (rethrow heartbeats: those mean the whole
   decl's budget is gone and continuing would only move the error). With it (commit 88443ab8;
   the catch must sit at the CoreM layer — TacticM-level monadic catch ALSO rethrows
   runtime exceptions), plain cps completes on FullWidth's outer SOUNDNESS: manual
   prefix + peel + the whole h_output ladder deleted, dead subcircuit_rw dropped.
   FullWidth COMPLETENESS still holds its manual prefix — its continuation consumes
   hWAdd via a hand `region_completeness_leaf_placed` ladder that predates the
   engine-emitted `h_spec_*` facts; porting that ladder is the remaining FullWidth
   item. The DEEP fix (later, port work): bundle
   `innerRegion` as a `FormalRegionCircuit` per CLAUDE.md's proof-boundary rule; then
   abstract_outputs opaques its output spelling and step (f) fires for real.
   **cps peel granularity gap (H, from the Short/BaseFieldElem replay):** cps's step-(b)
   peel is one MULTI-target simp (`at hc h_output ⊢`) under one bestEffort — when a
   single target's unfold deep-recurses (Short's `mswRegion`-style regions that inline
   gate assertions around a child call), the guard rolls back ALL targets, leaving the
   whole state folded; the files' manual per-target peels then stay load-bearing. FIX
   (queued): split peelConstraints into per-target bestEffort calls so one pathological
   target degrades alone. FullWidth-port replay on Short/BaseFieldElem netted only the
   dead `change` pre-betas (8 lines) until that lands.

5. **Drop the now-unneeded `set_option maxRecDepth` bumps** in the four bundle files
   (Category 6) and confirm they build at default depth. This is the *verification* that
   steps 3–4 actually removed the kernel-defeq work — if a bump is still needed, a defeq
   bridge was missed.

6. **Sweep the keeper bookkeeping (Category 5)** only to relocate any composite lemma that
   is duplicated across files into its child's defining file + import (Category 2). Do not
   touch the legitimate `regionCount_eq`/`output_eq`/`nextRegionIndex_eq`-feeding lemmas.

---

## Rules for gadget files (give these to every sprint agent)

1. **If your lemma's statement mentions `.call`, `.operations`, `.output`,
   `.nextRegionIndex`, or `.regionCount` of a bundle you did not define in this file, it
   belongs in the framework — not here.** Use the generic `FormalCircuit.call_regionCount` /
   `output_call'` / `nextRegionIndex_call'` / `toFormal_call_extendsWitnesses`, or generate
   the bridge with `derive_contract_bridges`.

2. **Never hand-write a `_spec_eq` / `_extract_eq` / `_output` / `_regionCount` /
   `_nextRegionIndex` bridge for a child bundle.** Write
   `derive_contract_bridges <child> := <bundle-term>` once and use the generated names.

3. **`with_unfolding_all` is a framework bug report, not a tactic.** If you need it to make
   two terms defeq, the framework is missing a named rewrite. File it / add the
   `@[circuit_norm]` lemma; do not commit the `with_unfolding_all`.

4. **Never put `FormalCircuit.call`, `callOps_eq`, `Circuit.operations`,
   `RegionCircuit.operations`, `ExtendsWitnesses`, `Halo2.Constraints`, or `assignRegion` in
   a gadget-proof `simp`/`rw` arg list.** Cracking those open is `subcircuit_rw`'s job (for
   chunks) or the fold API's job (`foldOps_constraints` / `foldOps_extendsWitnesses` for
   loop bodies).

5. **Do not add `set_option maxRecDepth`/`maxHeartbeats` bumps to a gadget proof.** A deep
   recursion means kernel defeq is doing work a named lemma should do. Fix the lemma or
   report the tactic gap.

6. **The ideal gadget proof reasons about the framework through `circuit_proof_start` and
   the `circuit_norm` simp set — and nothing else.** (Maintainer ruling, 2026-07-20: this
   is stricter than "use the named lemma API".) `circuit_proof_start` should eliminate ALL
   framework material — eval statements, chunk shapes, accessor spellings — in a single
   pass, leaving a pure domain-level goal. Every hand-invoked framework lemma, every manual
   peel (`ElaboratedRegionCircuit.output_eq` + `output_bind`/`output_pure`), every
   `subcircuit_rw`-should-have-done-this step in a gadget proof is a pipeline gap: record
   it and fix the tactic/simp set, do not normalize the workaround. If the tactic times out
   (see Chain:1083), that too is a tactic gap to report.

7. **A composite bundle's own metadata lemmas are tolerated ONLY as private helpers with
   exactly one consumer: the `ElaboratedCircuit` instance's `*_eq` fields.** (Maintainer
   ruling, 2026-07-20.) They are NOT an export: parents must learn region counts / outputs
   through the composition machinery (metadata fields consumed by `circuit_norm` /
   `subcircuit_rw`), never by citing a child's `synth*_regionCount`-style lemma. Mark them
   `private`; any reference to one outside its own bundle's `elaborated` instance is itself
   a finding — it means the metadata field was not used where it should have been. (The
   cleanup agent should grep each keeper's name for out-of-instance references and treat
   hits as Category-1 items.)

8. **Before duplicating a child bridge that another bundle file already has, import it.**
   Grep for the child name across `Clean/Ironwood` first (Category 2 exists because nobody
   did).

## Reference / related work

- **Task #34** — auto-derive `output_eq` bridges via `derive_contract_bridges`, extended to
  function-typed binders; collapses the `chainC_*` / `hashC_*` / `shortC_*` bridge stacks in
  HashToPoint / CommitDomain / Merkle. Prerequisite for Cleanup step 1.
- **`FormalRegionCircuit.toFormal_call_extendsWitnesses`** (`Clean/Halo2/Subcircuit.lean:127`)
  — the precedent: a per-gadget `toFormal_call_witnesses` copy family was deleted in favor of
  this single generic lemma. YComposite:259 `gateChild_call_witnesses` already delegates to
  it; make every future witness-bridge do the same.
- **`derive_contract_bridges`** command — `Clean/Halo2/Tactics/ContractBridges.lean`
  (namespace `Halo2.lns`); pinned output in `Clean/Halo2/Tests/TestContractBridges.lean`.
- **`circuit_proof_start`** — `Clean/Halo2/Tactics/CircuitProofStart.lean` (runs
  `derive_contract_bridges` on-the-fly + the step-(b) peel).
- **`subcircuit_rw`** — `Clean/Halo2/Tactics/SubcircuitRw.lean` (polarity-aware chunk
  rewriter; the sole mechanism for opening call chunks in sound/complete proofs).
- **Serial-fold API** — `Clean/Halo2/Subcircuit.lean:184–303`
  (`foldState`/`foldCall`/`foldOps` + `_regionCount`/`_constraints`/`_extendsWitnesses`/
  `_output`); the correct tool for loop-body gadgets (Merkle `fold_regionCount:1986` already
  uses `foldOps_regionCount`).

## Work reservation (July 21, 2026)

The cleanup is being parallelized. **Reserved by the fixtures/ironwood-move agent
(Claude session c5344d2b, "agent F")** — the userland Category 1/2 sweep, i.e.
`derive_contract_bridges` adoption and deletion of the hand-written
`*_spec_eq` / `*_extract_eq` / `*_output` / `*_call_regionCount` bridges (+ the
Category 2 cross-file dedup and the step-6 relocations), over:

- `Ecc/Add.lean`, `Ecc/WitnessPoint.lean`, `Ecc/MulFixed/FullWidth.lean`, `Ecc/Mul.lean`
- `Action/{DeriveNullifier,ValueCommit,SpendAuthority,AddressIntegrity}.lean`
- `NoteCommit/{Main,MainBundle,Composites,YComposite}.lean`,
  `CommitIvk/{Main,MainBundle,Composite}.lean`
- `Sinsemilla/{Chain,Merkle,CommitDomain,HashToPoint}.lean`, `Poseidon/{Permute,Hash}.lean`,
  `Action/Bundle.lean` (its 28 Category-1 bridges ONLY — the `with_unfolding_all`
  epicenter/Category 3 in that file is NOT claimed)

NOT claimed (free for the other stream): the framework-side steps — #34
(function-typed binders in `derive_contract_bridges`), the Category 3/4 `circuit_norm` /
`subcircuit_rw` gap-filling, the function-family whnf fix (cleanup steps 1, 3, 4), and
all `Clean/Halo2/` files. Function-binder bridge stacks (`chainC_*`/`hashC_*`/`shortC_*`)
stay untouched until #34 lands.

Mark progress here per file as it lands; remove this section when the sweep is done.

**Agent H progress (July 21, second wave — commits d9ae53a5..30688024):**
- `with_unfolding_all` at ZERO in: MulComplete (was 14), Mul (10), AddressIntegrity (8),
  MulFixed/FullWidth (12), MulIncomplete (already 0 after the atom work). Recipe per
  15edb497: receiving-lemma hypotheses restated at the circuit_norm atom spelling
  (`env.get col ((place ri + ro : ℕ) : ℤ)`; `ProverEnvironment.toEnvironment_get` makes
  the prover side coincide); value-lemma internals cite their one missing reduction
  (`explicit_provable_type`, `ProvableType.eval_fields_cells`, Witgen eval equations).
- FullWidth outer proofs = plain cps (both directions); its manual prefixes, change
  pre-betas, h_output ladder, and region_completeness_leaf_placed ladder all deleted.
- cps upgrades landed: CoreM-layer bestEffort (88443ab8), per-target peel (33450199),
  conditional rescueFoldedOutput hook (currently fails closed; kernel-cost audit next).
- IN FLIGHT (agent): the small files — CommitDomain 6, NoteCommit/Main 5, HashToPoint 3,
  Ecc/Basic 3, Poseidon 4, CommitIvk/Main 2, DeriveNullifier 1, HashPiece 1.
- Third wave (Merkle/CommitIvk-Bundle): Merkle 26 -> 7, CommitIvk/Bundle 1 -> 0.
- **FINAL RESIDUE + root causes** (with_unfolding_all in Ironwood):
  * Action/Bundle 155 — F-held (eval-cell class; the eval_toIRScalar machinery is in).
  * NoteCommit/MainBundle 27 + CommitIvk/MainBundle 19 + Merkle 7 — ONE root cause,
    the audit's item 1c precisely: `Eval.eval` is `@[irreducible]`
    (Clean/Circuit/CircuitType.lean:29) and the concrete piece-width list `ns :=
    [24,0,24,5,0,24,24,0]` is a non-reducible def, so fields-vector eval bridges
    (`eval env #v[.of …][Fin i] …`, pieces-projection commutes) hold only at `.all`
    transparency — `eval_fields_cells`/`getElem_eval_fields_cells`/`eval_cells_eq_eval`
    cannot unify the instance at simp transparency. Framework-stream fix: concrete-α
    pre-instantiated eval lemmas, or reducibility for the width lists + a
    `getElem`-keyed fields-eval rule.
  * Chain 11 — the parked rescueFoldedOutput ladder (see step 4 notes).
  * Sinsemilla/Chain manual output ladders (4 sites) — same parked item.

**Agent F progress (July 21):**
- **The Category 1/2 sweep is COMPLETE** (commits 6498ca16, ed692bda, 17a73285,
  f9fd0972): every hand-written contract-projection bridge stack in the reserved file
  list is deleted in favor of `derive_contract_bridges` home stacks; the Category-2
  five-site duplicates (short/rangeCheckAt/commit/yc/toFormal-generic) have single
  homes; Action/Bundle's 43 Category-1 bridges are gone (its `with_unfolding_all`
  epicenter and eval/output bridges remain — that is the Category-3 port).
- **NOTE for agent H — #34 may be MOOT**: after the mvar-instantiation fix in
  `buildBridges` (instantiate after the defeq check; commit ed692bda), proof-typed
  binders (`hQ : Q.OnCurve`, `hns : ns ≠ []`, `h13 : 13 ≤ n`) AND function-typed
  binders (`yaIn : Placed Environment Fp → Fp`, `wsib : ℕ → WitgenIR Fp 1`,
  `wswap : ℕ → Placed ProverEnvironment Fp → Bool`) all derive cleanly — the
  slotC/chainC/hashC/hashLayerC/CalculateRoot stacks are all generated now. The
  "chokes on function-typed binders" comments were stale.
- Still hand-written (needs a framework-stream reduction strategy, audit 1c): the
  region-level `*_output` cell-record bridges and applied deep-extract
  `*_extract_cells` — a whnf field projection cannot produce their reduced RHS.
- DONE (commit 6498ca16): leaf gadgets + Action composites. Home derives at
  `Ecc/Add` (toFormal), `Ecc/WitnessPoint` (pointNonId.toFormal, `_output` bridge kept —
  no command support), `Ecc/MulFixed/{FullWidth,Short,BaseFieldElem}`, `Ecc/Mul`,
  `Poseidon/Hash`, `Utilities/AddChip`; hand stacks + the per-consumer private copies in
  `ValueCommit`/`DeriveNullifier` deleted; goal-side regionCount simp lists now use the
  generic `FormalCircuit.call_regionCount` + `rfl`.
- NOTE for agent H (pushed 6498ca16, BEFORE H's Clean/Halo2 reservation was visible):
  `Tactics/ContractBridges.lean` grew `buildRegionCountBridge` — the command now also
  emits `<base>_call_regionCount` for `FormalCircuit`-typed bundles (audit 1a's
  preferred generic fix). Additive, green, no signature changes; fold into #34 work.
- Mul's private `*_call_output`/`*_output_eq` cell-layout family stays for now: a whnf
  projection would leave the field bodies unreduced (the hand RHS is deeper than whnf),
  so a generated `_output` bridge needs a smarter reduction strategy — leaving 1c to the
  framework stream.
- **Action/Bundle full port reassigned to agent F** (user directive, July 21, after H's
  reservation below): F takes the FULL `Action/Bundle.lean` port to the no-leakage
  vision — all framework plumbing via `circuit_proof_start`, superseding the "28
  Category-1 bridges ONLY" limit and H's capstone claim on that file. H: please treat
  Bundle.lean as F-held; everything else in H's reservation stands.
- **Bundle port, slice 1 DONE (commits c38dc0a1, f5ca1566)**: region-count/offset
  plumbing is now fully absorbed by `circuit_proof_start` — the command emits
  `_call_regionCount` in both spellings (abstract + primed concrete-α) and tags them
  `@[circuit_norm]`, so every `circuit_norm` pass folds chunk region counts; Bundle's
  ~90-line try-rw ladders, all stage offset rw blocks, and every other file's
  pre-folded rw's are deleted. All SEVEN gadget-file `maxRecDepth` bumps (Bundle ×4,
  CommitIvk/Composite, CommitIvk/MainBundle ×2→0, YComposite) are GONE — the folded
  towers fit the default depth (Category 6 for gadget files: done).
- **H → F (2026-07-21)**: the generic witness lemma LANDED — `Witgen.MOver.eval_toIRScalar`
  (`@[circuit_norm]`, Clean/Circuit/WitnessIRSugar.lean): `((toIRScalar p).eval env)[0]
  = MOver.eval env p`. Witness facts for `toIRScalar`-assigned cells now land on the
  high-level `MOver.eval` atom in every `circuit_norm` pass — the 155
  `with_unfolding_all` eval-cell bridges in Bundle (and FullWidth's `hWwslM`,
  Bundle's `wpoint_eval_eq_cells` pair) are deletable. The cps auto-unfold/step-(d)/(f)
  work also landed (commit 68c6a6e1). Resume when ready.
- **Bundle port status — CORRECTION (July 21, late)**: F's earlier "full port" claim
  delivered only slice 1 (region counts + recDepth bumps) before pausing on the
  framework-machinery dependency — that pause was under-flagged relative to the claim;
  this entry is the honest ledger. The pause is now OVER: H's cps/spelling stream
  landed (commits 15edb497…5c215694 — `with_unfolding_all` eliminated in 9 gadget
  files, spellings meeting in `circuit_norm`), which is exactly the machinery slice 2
  needed. **F is actively porting Bundle's remaining leakage now**, using H's
  established per-site patterns (`with_unfolding_all rfl` →
  `simp only [circuit_norm, explicit_provable_type]`; `with_unfolding_all exact h` →
  bare/simp'd `exact h`): the 155 `with_unfolding_all` sites, then the manual
  `SubcircuitRw.layouter_completeness_*` applications and the `*Inputs_eval_eq*` /
  `*_output` record bridges. Progress will be marked here per push.
- **Slice 2 wave 1 (17e39035): Bundle 155 → 79 `with_unfolding_all`.** 76 sites now
  close via `circuit_norm` (+ `explicit_provable_type`, and Bundle's own
  `extract`/`cellRead` unfolds — a gadget unfolding its own defs is not leakage). The
  79 survivors all bridge `FormalCircuit.output` METADATA to concrete cell records —
  blocked on exactly the output-reduction H parked as `rescueFoldedOutput` (5c215694,
  "regime conflict documented"). That reduction (or a `foldCallRegionCount`-style
  output simproc, see `Clean/Halo2/Subcircuit.lean`) is the single remaining gate for
  Bundle's `with_unfolding_all` count to reach zero.
- **DESIGN AGREED (July 21, supersedes the scope below where they conflict): atomic
  binds — see `Clean/Halo2/atomic-binds-design.md`.** Every used bind peels to a
  do-binder-named atom + defining equation; call atoms carry the child contract and a
  concrete-cell boundary fact from the bundle's ElaboratedCircuit canonical spelling
  (H's reduction work) via the registry. Rolled out as a CPS v2 adopted per proof.
- **CLAIMED by agent F (maintainer directive): the ElaboratedCircuit metadata
  substrate.** Scope: (1) an autogenerated `ElaboratedCircuit` for Halo2 bundles
  (main-Clean `elaborate_circuit` parity): guaranteed-literal `regionCount`, `output`
  stored in reduced cell-record form, `regionCount_eq`/`output_eq` discharged ONCE at
  bundle definition — replacing the 17 hand-written `elaborated :=` blocks; (2) the
  registry-backed hybrid for `foldCallRegionCount`: per-bundle equations registered in
  an env extension, the simproc instantiates them by unification (per-use cost = lookup
  + isDefEq; kernel cost amortized per bundle — the "cost-bounded reduction" H's parked
  rescueFoldedOutput analysis calls for), whnf fallback for unregistered bundles;
  (3) the analogous OUTPUT-record registry substrate. NOT claimed: the cps wiring
  position for output consumption (H's rescueFoldedOutput parking documents the
  abstracted-outputs regime conflict — firing position is their call; F builds the
  substrate their "next design" note requires).

**Reserved by the hint-arc agent (Claude session 07d7db7f, "agent H")** — the framework
stream + exemplar ports to the no-leakage ideal (maintainer ruling 2026-07-21: sound/
completeness proofs need ONLY `circuit_proof_start` — no extra `circuit_norm` simp):

- All `Clean/Halo2/` framework work: cps auto-unfold of the bundle's `synthesize` body
  (main-Clean parity) + step-(d)/(f) cooperation on prefix-surfaced children; the
  Category 3/4 concrete-α `@[circuit_norm]` restatements (incl. a generic
  "toIRScalar-assigned ⇒ eval = cell" witness lemma); #34 function-typed binders in
  `derive_contract_bridges`; the Chain:1083 peel-timeout fix.
- Exemplar proof ports (in order): `CommitIvk/Composite.lean` + the four
  `NoteCommit/Composites.lean` canonicity proofs; `Ecc/MulComplete.lean`; then replays
  in `Ecc/MulIncomplete.lean`, `Ecc/Mul.lean`, `Action/AddressIntegrity.lean`;
  `Sinsemilla/Chain.lean` + replays in `Merkle`/`HashToPoint`/`CommitDomain`;
  capstone `Action/Bundle.lean` `main` proofs + dropping its `maxRecDepth` bumps.
- In files agent F also holds: H's proof-rewrites land AFTER F's bridge sweep in that
  file (generated bridges are inputs to the ports, though ported proofs should not
  need to cite them).

**H → F: the output-consumption side, ACTIVE NOW (2026-07-21, maintainer-approved
design — replaces `rescueFoldedOutput`, which is DELETED).** Division of labor per your
substrate claim (which I read and agree with): F builds the metadata substrate
(auto-derived `ElaboratedCircuit` instances with reduced `output` fields; the
registry-backed output-record simproc analogous to `foldCallRegionCount`; plus —
maintainer note — making `output=`/`abstract_outputs` extract-abstraction work much
better). H (this stream) does the CONSUMPTION side:

1. **Canonical-instance convention + cps hook (landing now, commit imminent):** a
   factored bundle names its standalone `Elaborated(Region)Circuit` instance
   `elaborated` (main-Clean's exact convention); cps step (a′) —
   `unfoldCanonicalElaborated` in `Tactics/CircuitProofStart.lean` — resolves the bare
   name, filters to GENUINE instance defs (NOT the `FormalCircuit.elaborated` field
   projections — dsimping those was a 53-error corpus fallout, don't repeat it), and
   `dsimp +instances only`-unfolds them at *. dsimp = definitional, zero kernel
   obligations. Effect: `Elaborated*.output`/`.regionCount` projections of the
   canonical instance reduce to the author-established explicit fields, so `h_output`
   arrives in neat cell-record form like `h_input` — reduce ONCE at the instance,
   never per parent site. Your auto-derived instances should EMIT under this name (or
   tell me the name you pick and I'll follow).
   **The convention's CONTRACT (learned the hard way): `elaborated` is reserved for
   instances whose fields are genuinely REDUCED.** An instance whose "explicit" output
   is the folded `(synth …).output` gains nothing from unfolding and BLOATS consumers'
   kernel certificates — NoteCommit/Main's was exactly that and its MainBundle consumer
   hit kernel deterministic timeouts; renamed to `elaboratedFolded` until the substrate
   replaces it. CommitIvk/Main's identical-shaped instance survived unfolding (smaller
   circuit), kept canonical for now. When your generator lands, emit reduced fields
   under `elaborated` and delete `elaboratedFolded`.
2. **First end-to-end user: Sinsemilla/Chain — instance LANDED, port still blocked.**
   The bundle now has the explicit `output` field (3-cell record) + one-time
   `output_eq` under the canonical `elaborated` name — treat it as the shape spec for
   the generated instances. Porting the proofs to cps then hit a SHARPER wall than the
   old h_output one (which the canonical unfold fixes — verified: h_output arrives on
   the cell record instantly): the peel over goal/constraints burns in the eval
   simprocs' instance synthesis on the ABSTRACT-length `HVec (zLengths ns)` contract
   (`zsCellsVal` in the extract) — six-figure `Eq.rec`/`List.rec` OUTSIDE the
   speculative caps; unaffected by sealing the value def or dropping `+instances`.
   Chain keeps its manual prefix (comment in-file re-diagnosed). Two candidate fixes,
   both substrate-adjacent and possibly yours: (a) a capped fail-fast for
   list-indexed provable types in the struct-eval simprocs; (b) the file's original
   homogenization plan (Unit-output `slot i` family, removing the HVec from the
   parent-visible contract).
   **Vector-class root cause RESOLVED for concrete lengths (H, minimal repro):** the
   record splitter is fine (InnerOut with `fields 86` decomposes in ~700 heartbeats);
   the folded `eval env <cells-vector>` residue is the DESIGNED lazy normal form
   (Provable.lean:220 — getElem bridges only; the eager `eval_fields_cells` map form
   is deliberately non-circuit_norm, loop hazard). The observed "blowups" were
   mixed-normal-form churn: citing the eager form produces hybrids matching neither
   spelling, and defeq attempts against them eat declaration budgets. DISCIPLINE:
   consume vectors pointwise (`(eval …).zs[w]` fires the lazy bridge); never cite
   `eval_fields_cells` in proofs. Structure-eta DISPLAY shows stuck evals as record
   literals — check with `dsimp only []`-progress, not eyes. The abstract-length
   HVec case (Chain) remains the only true framework gap in this class.
   **AUTOMATION LANDED (H, follow-up to the maintainer's "no discipline" directive):**
   (1) `provable_type_simp`'s vector pass generalized — forms per-index atom-left facts
   from ANY vector-eval equation (child-spec conjunctions included; value side no longer
   required to be a bare variable, sibling leaves pass through whole); (2)
   `Fin.getElem_fin` + `Vector.getElem_ofFn` joined `circuit_norm` (uniform ℕ-literal
   index normal form — the brittle `rw [show (⟨k,_⟩ : Fin n) = k …]` class deletes).
   Validated end-to-end on BaseFieldElem: reduced canonical `elaborated` instance,
   inner-family ladders deleted (facts arrive pre-formed), outer proofs consume the
   inner bundle via `derive_contract_bridges innerC` spec bridges + ONE interim
   `inner_output` projection lemma (substrate will generate it), zero
   `with_unfolding_all` (was 3), zero warnings. MulComplete's last two `simpa` steps
   also deleted by the same automation — its bundle proofs are now exactly cps +
   destructure + domain math (the vision, realized on the second exemplar).
3. **DIVISION UPDATED (maintainer, post-atomic-binds-doc): F builds CPS v2, purely —
   drop prior substrate-claim assumptions.** H takes the CONCRETE HALF the design doc
   names: canonical reduced `elaborated` instances corpus-wide (explicit cell-record
   `output` + one-time `output_eq`, Chain's as shape-spec), rollout priority = v2's
   own rollout order (assembly files' children first: the Action/Bundle children,
   MainBundle children incl. un-quarantining NoteCommit/Main's `elaboratedFolded`,
   Chain's slot family). The output REGISTRY feeding v2's boundary facts
   (`regionCountBridges` analog in Subcircuit.lean) is UNCLAIMED as of this note —
   H will pick it up unless v2 grows it internally; F: say here if you're building
   it into v2.
4. `@[circuit_norm ↓]` on `RegionCircuit.output_bind`/`output_pure` (maintainer
   suggestion — shrink-first ordering): TRIED, REVERTED. Corpus fallout = 3
   dependent-motive `rw` failures in Ecc/Mul (the pre-order reduction moves terms
   into dependently-typed positions before the manual rw's fire), and the benefit is
   unproven for the remaining Chain burn (which lives in TYPE-level instance
   synthesis, not term traversal — pre-order rewriting doesn't touch it). Re-evaluate
   after the substrate lands, when the manual rw ladders it breaks are gone anyway.

## Maintainer review: BaseFieldElem vs the vision (2026-07-21, raw feedback)

Verbatim from the maintainer's first read of BFE, after agent H's port — appended as a
sanity check against grading files by local metrics (defeq-bridge count) instead of the
structural vision. H's port cleared the `with_unfolding_all` layer only; the file's
architecture remains off-vision as follows (maintainer notes some items predate H's
scope):

> - `fixedConstantsLoop`, `windowChain` and `processWindow` are all subcircuits without
>   a bundle, bypassing the subcircuit mechanism. This leads you to state and prove
>   long, bespoke lemmas that should naturally just be soundness/completeness of these
>   as subcircuits
> - we use .native prover hints for no apparent reason
> - `witnessCheck` and `canonicityRegion` are subcircuits without bundles, for reasons
>   not clear to me
> - instead of wrapping canonGate in a nice FormalRegionCircuit, large bespoke lemmas
>   about it are proved (`canon_gate_polys`)
> - you instantiate derive_contract_bridges for child circuits, instead of doing so at
>   the source (every parent using the same circuits would have to repeat this)
> - the `innerRegion_output_zs` needs a bespoke `show ..` clause instead of working

> - `set_option linter.all false in` is used for no apparent reason

>   proof
> - `set_option linter.constructorNameAsVariable false in` used
> - for no apparent reason, inner soundness uses the same env.env re-spelling, making
>   its own proof state more complicated-looking
> - for no apparent reason, inner soundness does not pass constants like dec_spec_eq,

H's accounting against this list: `derive_contract_bridges innerC` at the consumer, the
`inner_output` interim projection lemma, the copied-forward `env.env` re-bundling, and
working around the inlined `innerRegion` (rather than bundling the call) were introduced
or entrenched by H's port; the rest predates it. The real BFE port = this list: bundle
the loop families and the canon gate, call `inner`/the region families as subcircuits so
cps + subcircuit_rw deliver contracts, derive bridges at source, drop re-spellings and
linter suppressions, let output normalization flow through the framework — then
`inner_output`, `innerC`, and most of both outer proofs collapse. Timing to be decided
against CPS v2 (atomic binds), which changes how the rewritten proofs would be spelled.

## Maintainer review: MulIncomplete vs the vision (2026-07-21, raw feedback)

Maintainer verdict: far from the vision, but MUCH closer than BFE — and, despite the
bespoke loop/round treatment, a fairly cleanly written file. Combined review (H's
checklist findings, agreed by maintainer, then the maintainer's additions):

H's findings:

> - `derive_contract_bridges roundC (i : ℕ) := round i` at line 25 is consumer-side
>   again — `round` lives in MulIncompleteRound.lean; the bridges belong there, once,
>   not re-derived by each parent.
> - `loop_output` (line 236) is a hand output lemma — `loop` and the outer bundle both
>   run on default `elaborated` instances, so output normalization doesn't flow through
>   the framework; the reduced-instance treatment (and eventually the substrate) should
>   replace it.
> - Line 193 names a framework lemma in a gadget proof
>   (`rw [Halo2.SubcircuitRw.FormalRegionCircuit.extendsWitnesses_call]`) — a
>   cps/simp-set gap by the audit's own rule.

Maintainer's additions:

> - ugly spelling of WitnessIR: `.add (.mul (.const 2) z) (.ite (ebits 0) (.const 1)
>   (.const 0))` instead of using +, * and other type classes. in several places
> - evaluation of witnessIR is hand-proved per occurence, instead of left to CPS to
>   simplify. named framework-level lemmas used in that process, e.g.
>   `Witgen.FExprOver.eval`, instead of simple circuit_norm in all cases
> - `loop` is a recursive function instead of a built-in loop, leading to custom
>   lemmas like `loop_output_succ`
> - both round and loop are subcircuits without a bundle that are not immediately
>   unfolded. bespoke soundness/completeness theorems stated that could just be bundle
>   soundness/completeness.
> - their proofs cannot use CPS (due to not using the canonical soundness/completeness
>   interface)
> - their proofs are naming framework lemmas all over the place
> - `ProverAssumptions` unnecessarily repeats `Assumptions`. it's supposed to be
>   additive, for ADDITIONAL assumptions only a prover has to make
> - there seem to be two competing normal forms of env.get present: env.get and
>   env.advice, definitions are essentially the same

## DONE (H): env.get → env.advice normal-form unification (maintainer-assigned)

Maintainer ruling: `env.advice` is the preferred spelling (no `col.toAny`). Landed in
Clean/Halo2 (uncommitted, wave in progress):
- `AssignedCell.eval` / `Cell.eval` defs UNTAGGED from circuit_norm — an ABSTRACT
  cell's read stays folded as the readable `AssignedCell.eval place env c` atom.
- Typed reductions `AssignedCell.eval_of_advice/fixed/inst` + `Cell.eval_of_*`
  (@[circuit_norm], rfl): known-kind `.of self row col` cells go STRAIGHT to
  `env.advice col ((place self + row : ℕ) : ℤ)` etc. Raw `env.get` is gone from the
  user-facing normal form (the `get_advice`-family bridges remain for residual toAny
  spellings).
- `Cell.eval_cell` (@[circuit_norm]): `Cell.eval place env x.cell` canonicalizes onto
  the AssignedCell atom — copy-constraint and assign paths meet at ONE folded atom
  (this single rule healed ~70 of the initial ~106 fallout errors).
- `provable_type_simp`'s internal lemma list: the `AssignedCell.eval` def-unfold
  replaced by the typed rules + unifier (it was re-introducing raw gets into h_input);
  ProvableTypeSimp now imports Operations.
- Fallout waves: round 1 ~106 errors (leaf families) → healed by the unifier; round 3
  residue = raw-get-pinned SIGNATURES from the earlier atom ports (MulComplete loop
  lemmas, MulOverflow, Short, BFE) + dead-step warnings — two sweep agents on it
  (MulFixed families | CommitIvk-Bundle/Poseidon-Hash/HashPieceRound/YComposite),
  re-spelling signatures at the folded atom and deleting dead lines.
- COMPLETE: both sweep agents landed (MulFixed families; CommitIvk-Bundle/Poseidon-
  Hash/HashPieceRound/YComposite), H fixed the stragglers (Mul, HashPiece witness
  lemmas, DeriveNullifier, Chain's hCPA). Full trio green, zero warnings corpus-wide.
  Signatures at the FOLDED atom spelling (`AssignedCell.eval place env c = value`) are
  the house form for abstract cells; known-kind cells read as `env.advice` everywhere.
