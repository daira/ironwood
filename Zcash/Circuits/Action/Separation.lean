# The pre- and post-NU6.3 circuits differ exactly by same-address enforcement

The circuit used after the NU6.3 upgrade adds exactly one clause to the Action statement:
the cross-address binding. This file pins that fact, machine-checked at the deployed
generators and bases:

* `preNU63_synthesize_eq_base` — the pre-NU6.3 circuit is definitionally `synthesizeBase`
  alone: it never runs the `synthCrossAddressChecks` region the NU6.3 `synthesize` appends
  (`Circuit.lean`).
* `specPost_iff_base_and_crossAddress` — the post-NU6.3 contract `SpecPost` is exactly the
  base statement `SpecBase` conjoined with the cross-address clause, so the two differ in
  precisely that clause.
* `preNU63_spec_omits_crossAddress` — the pre-NU6.3 contract `Spec` guarantees only
  `SpecBase` (plus its output-carrying rows), without the cross-address clause.
* `crossAddressBinding_nontrivial` — that clause is a genuine restriction: a witness with
  the flag set and distinct old/new diversified bases falsifies it.

Not established here:
* That consensus nodes correctly implement the rules specifying which verifying key is
  used before and after NU6.3 activation.
* A *satisfying* pre-NU6.3 witness that violates the clause — i.e.
  `¬ ∀ wit, SpecBase G B wit → crossAddressBinding wit`. A concrete such witness must
  open the honest `Commit^ivk`/note/nullifier chains, whose `ivk • g_d` and
  Poseidon-scalar terms are ~255-bit `nsmul`s that `native_decide` cannot evaluate; that
  separation is left as the remaining step.

/-- **The pre-NU6.3 circuit is `synthesizeBase` alone.**  Definitionally equal — the NU6.3
`synthCrossAddressChecks` region is absent, so no constraint of the pre-NU6.3 key depends on
`disableCrossAddress`. -/
theorem preNU63_synthesize_eq_base :
    CircuitPreNU63.synthesize G B W cfg = synthesizeBase G B W cfg := rfl

/-- The post-NU6.3 cross-address binding, as a standalone clause: a nonzero
`disableCrossAddress` forces both new-note address components to equal the old note's. -/
def crossAddressBinding (wit : ActionData) : Prop :=
  wit.disableCrossAddress ≠ 0 → wit.gdOld = wit.gdNew ∧ wit.pkdOld = wit.pkdNew

/-- **The NU6.3 contract is the base contract plus exactly the cross-address clause.**  The two
statements separate in precisely this conjunct. -/
theorem specPost_iff_base_and_crossAddress (wit : ActionData) :
    SpecPost G B () () wit ↔ SpecBase G B wit ∧ crossAddressBinding wit := Iff.rfl

/-- **The pre-NU6.3 contract omits the cross-address clause.**  Its guarantee is `SpecBase`
(with the output-carrying rows); nothing in it constrains the cross-address relation, so a prover
bound only by the old key is free on it. -/
theorem preNU63_spec_omits_crossAddress
    (out : Value AddressPoints Fp) (wit : ActionData)
    (h : Spec G B () out wit) : SpecBase G B wit := h.1

/-- **The cross-address clause is a real restriction.**  A witness carrying `disableCrossAddress = 1`
with distinct old/new diversified bases falsifies it — so conjoining it in `SpecPost` genuinely
narrows the accepted set relative to `SpecBase`.  (`merkleQ`/`ivkQ` are two distinct deployed
domain points, used here only as a convenient pair of unequal on-curve points.) -/
