# `projectCS` — Halo2-Clean `ConstraintSystem` → ironwood `CsFixture`

Projects a Halo2-Clean `ConstraintSystem Fp` (the output of running a chip's `configure`)
into the ironwood-shaped `CsFixture`, so it can be compared for **equality** against a
fixture dumped from the actual Rust circuit (`AddPre.lean` / `AddPost.lean`).

Two pieces (design doc `vk-matching-design.md` §3):

* **The first-encounter query-index walk** (halo2 `circuit.rs` `query_{advice,fixed,
  instance}_index`): halo2 assigns each *new* `(column, rotation)` the next query index, in
  the order the query is first *built* inside a gate closure. We reproduce that order by a
  left-to-right traversal of each gate polynomial (matching the order the Rust closure
  constructs its sub-expressions), gate by gate. The walk simultaneously (a) accumulates
  the `{advice,fixed,instance}QueryLayout` lists and (b) rewrites each `Query` atom to its
  index, erasing `Halo2.Expression Fp Query` into the index-based `Expr Fp`.

* **The operator erasure** (`Clean/Halo2/Expression.lean:104-109`): Halo2-Clean's four-node
  `Expression` (`var/const/add/mul`) is lowered to ironwood's `Expr` matching how Rust's
  `std::ops` build `Expression<F>`: `Neg`/`Sub` produce `mul (const (-1)) e ↦ .negated e`,
  `add ↦ .sum`, `mul ↦ .product`, `const ↦ .constant`, and `var ↦ .advice/.fixed/.instance/
  .selector`. `.scaled` — Rust `expr * field` (`impl Mul<F>`) — DOES arise in the mul chain
  (its lookup, bitshift, incomplete `TWO_INV` and LSB gates use it): it is the `mul e (const c)`
  case, constant on the RIGHT, spelled in ports via the `HMul (Expression F L) F` instance as
  `e * (c : Fp)`. A genuine `Constant * e` product is `mul (const c) e` (constant on the LEFT).

Pre-compression keeps `.selector`; post-compression is handled by `projectCSPost` which
substitutes each simple selector by its packed fixed column (for a single-selector gadget:
one new fixed column, replacement = the bare fixed query — see `compress_selectors.rs`).

/-! ### The query-registration seed (halo2 `queried_cells`)

**Load-bearing subtlety** (design doc D6): halo2 assigns query indices in the order
`query_advice`/`query_fixed`/`query_instance` are *called* inside each gate/lookup closure —
i.e. the order the queries are *declared*, not the order they appear in the finished
polynomial AST. A gate authored as "declare all queries via `let`, then build polys" (the
standard idiom, and how the ports read) registers in `let` order; but the first poly's AST
may reference those queries in a different order. So a naive first-encounter walk over the
finished polynomials produces the wrong layout *and* the wrong in-gate indices.

We reproduce halo2 faithfully by pre-seeding the walk with each gate's queried cells in
declaration order (halo2's `Gate::queried_cells`, `circuit.rs`). This seed is per-gadget
data supplied by the caller (the fixture test), exactly mirroring what the Rust closure
records. Once seeded, the erasure DFS finds every query already registered and reuses its
index, matching halo2 for both the layout and the gate expressions. Queries not in the seed
(should be none for a faithful seed) are appended in first-encounter order as a fallback. -/

/-- Pre-register a declaration-order list of query atoms into the walk state. -/
def seedQueries : List Query → QueryState → QueryState
  | [], s => s
  | .selector _ :: qs, s => seedQueries qs s
  | .advice col rot :: qs, s => seedQueries qs (s.advIdx col.index rot).2
  | .fixed col rot :: qs, s => seedQueries qs (s.fixIdx col.index rot).2
  | .instance col rot :: qs, s => seedQueries qs (s.instIdx col.index rot).2

/-- Project a Halo2-Clean `ConstraintSystem` (pre-compression) into the ironwood
`CsFixture`: flatten gates, run the query walk + erasure (seeded with the whole chain's
registration-order queries), erase the lookups, read the counts.

**Seed = whole-circuit registration order** (design doc D6 generalised to multiple gadgets):
halo2 assigns query indices in the order `query_{advice,fixed,instance}` are *called*
across all `create_gate`/`lookup` closures, in configure-call order. So `seed` is the
concatenation, in configure order, of each gate's/lookup's declaration-order queries. Once
the seed pre-registers every query, both `eraseGates` and `eraseLookups` only *look up*
indices (never append), so gates and lookups can be erased in their own list order over the
shared, fully-seeded state — the query layout is fixed by the seed alone. -/
def projectCS (seed : List Query) (cs : ConstraintSystem Fp) : CsFixture :=
  let s0 := seedQueries seed {}
  let (gates, s) := eraseGates (flatGates cs) s0
  let (lookups, s) := eraseLookups cs.lookups s
  { numAdviceColumns := cs.numAdviceColumns
    numFixedColumns := cs.numFixedColumns

    adviceQueryLayout := s.advice.toList
    fixedQueryLayout := s.fixed.toList
    instanceQueryLayout := s.inst.toList
    gates := gates
    lookups := lookups }

/-! ## Post-compression projection (single-selector gadget)

For a gadget with `numSelectors = 1` simple selector active in its gate, `compress_selectors`
packs it into one new fixed column with `combination_len = 1`, `assigned_root = 1`, so the
replacement expression is the *bare* fixed query on the new column (no `∏(i−q)` factor). The
new fixed column index is `numFixedColumns` (appended after the existing fixed columns), and
its query is registered (via `query_fixed_index`) the *first* time a substituted selector is
encountered during the gate rewrite — i.e. at fixed-query index 0 if there were no prior
fixed queries.

This mirrors halo2's order: compression substitutes selectors first, then the query walk runs
over the substituted expressions. We model that by substituting `Query.selector` for a fixed
query on the packed column *before* the walk. -/

/-- Substitute a single simple selector by a fixed query on the packed column `packedCol`,
rotation 0 (the `combination_len = 1` replacement). Leaves everything else untouched. -/

  | .var (.selector _) => .var (.fixed ⟨packedCol⟩ 0)

  | .const c => .const c
  | .add a b => .add (substSelector packedCol a) (substSelector packedCol b)
  | .mul a b => .mul (substSelector packedCol a) (substSelector packedCol b)

/-- Project the post-compression CS for a **single-selector** gadget: substitute the
selector by the packed fixed column (index = old `numFixedColumns`), grow `numFixedColumns`
by 1, drop `numSelectors` to 0 (selectors don't survive compression), then run the same walk. -/
def projectCSPost (seed : List Query) (cs : ConstraintSystem Fp) : CsFixture :=
  let packedCol := cs.numFixedColumns
  let polys := (flatGates cs).map (substSelector packedCol)
  -- The substituted selector becomes a fixed query on the packed column; register it in
  -- the fixed layout (halo2 does this via `query_fixed_index` during substitution, before
  -- the advice/instance seed of the following gates). Prepend it to the fixed seed.
  let (gates, s) := eraseGates polys (seedQueries (Query.fixed ⟨packedCol⟩ 0 :: seed) {})
  { numAdviceColumns := cs.numAdviceColumns
    numFixedColumns := cs.numFixedColumns + 1
    numInstanceColumns := cs.numInstanceColumns
    numSelectors := cs.numSelectors
    adviceQueryLayout := s.advice.toList
    fixedQueryLayout := s.fixed.toList
    instanceQueryLayout := s.inst.toList
    gates := gates }

/-! ## Post-compression projection (general, multi-selector, map-driven)

`compress_selectors` (`circuit.rs:1232-1338`, `compress_selectors.rs`) is a **whole-circuit,
layout-dependent** step (design doc §2.4): which selectors pack into a shared fixed column
is decided by the *exclusion matrix* over the full per-selector activation table (two
selectors may share a column iff never co-enabled on a row, subject to the degree budget),
and each selector's replacement is the root-finding polynomial `q·∏_{i≠root}(i − q)` over
its packed column's fixed query.

**Trust boundary** (task §Lean-side 9): the map's derivation stays RUST-side. The dumper's
harness circuit (`MulDumpCircuit`, `ecc/chip/dump.rs`) runs a REAL mul synthesize through
the floor planner with `Value::unknown()` witnesses — exactly keygen's view (keygen ignores
advice values; the lookup TABLE contents affect only fixed commitments, never the compressed
CS structure, so the table is not loaded) — gathering the TRUE activation table, and
`dump_prepost_acts` runs the real `compress_selectors` on it, emitting `MulSelMap.lean`
(per selector: packed column, combination length, assigned root). Lean applies the map
MECHANICALLY (`substSelectorMap` below) and the resulting CS is checked EQUAL to the dumped
post-compression fixture — any error in the reconstruction conventions (root order, factor
shape, query registration) surfaces as a gate mismatch in that equality. -/

/-- Build the root-finding replacement polynomial `q·∏_{i≠root}((i : Fp) − q)` for a selector,
`q` being the packed column's fixed query (`compress_selectors.rs:184-208`; left-assoc fold,
matching Rust's `expression = expression * (Constant(root) − query)` accumulation). For
`combinationLen = 1` this is the bare `q` (empty product) — the single-selector and
degree-0 (complex/lookup-only selector) cases. -/
def selReplacement (d : SelCompress) : Expression Fp Query :=
  let q : Expression Fp Query := var (.fixed ⟨d.packedCol⟩ 0)
  let factors := (List.range d.combinationLen).filterMap (fun j =>
    let i := j + 1
    if i = d.assignedRoot then none
    else some (((i : Fp) : Expression Fp Query) - q))
  factors.foldl (· * ·) q

/-- Substitute each `Query.selector k` by its root-finding replacement from the map `m`
(`k ↦ SelCompress`). Selectors not in the map are left as-is (should not happen for a
complete map). Rust substitutes in gates AND lookups (`circuit.rs:1321-1335` — lookup
expressions carry the complex selectors). -/
def substSelectorMap (m : ℕ → Option SelCompress) :
    Expression Fp Query → Expression Fp Query
  | .var (.selector s) => match m s.index with
      | some d => selReplacement d
      | none => .var (.selector s)
  | .var q => .var q
  | .const c => .const c
  | .add a b => .add (substSelectorMap m a) (substSelectorMap m b)
  | .mul a b => .mul (substSelectorMap m a) (substSelectorMap m b)

/-- Project the post-compression CS with a Rust-dumped selector-compression map: substitute
every selector (in gates and lookups) by its root-finding replacement, grow
`numFixedColumns` by the new packed columns, and run the same seeded query walk.

Halo2's post-compression query order: the packed columns' fixed queries are registered at
column-ALLOCATION time inside `compress_selectors` (`circuit.rs:1267-1274`, via
`query_fixed_index` in the allocate closure), i.e. all new fixed queries append to the
pre-compression fixed layout in packing order, BEFORE the substituted gates are walked. The
`seed` (built from the dumped post fixture's layouts, or equivalently pre-layout ++ packed
columns) reproduces this. `numSelectors` is NOT reset by compression (halo2 keeps the count;
the pinned VK doesn't carry it — design doc §2.3). -/
