# The fast Lagrange commitment

`commit_lagrange` — a Pedersen vector commitment against a fixed basis, plus a blind — is the
operation the verifying-key derivation runs 44 times over 2048-term columns, and it dominates
that computation. This module gives the fast evaluation path for it (`commitLagrangeMontWith`)
together with the PROVEN equality to the naive spec (`commitLagrangeMontWith_eq`), so a caller
gets the speed without the statement ever mentioning the fast route.

The speed comes from running the MSM over the **proven eight-limb Montgomery field**:
`CompElliptic.Curves.Pasta.Fast.ProjectiveMontDefs` is the core-only twin of the group kernels
(RCB addition, double-and-add, scatter Pippenger) there, compiled to native code through the
`FastFieldNative` `precompileModules` leaf. This module is mathlib-side and deliberately NOT in
that leaf's glob: it holds the `ZMod`-typed entry points — coordinates into Montgomery form,
kernel, affine reading back — and chains the kernel's simulation theorem `msmM_spec` into the
`_eq` ladder that lands on `Msm.commitLagrangeSpec`.

`ofPVesM` must never be compared definitionally: unfolding it exposes the CIOS (Coarsely
Integrated Operand Scanning) rounds, so the equalities below are stated and proved by rewriting only.
