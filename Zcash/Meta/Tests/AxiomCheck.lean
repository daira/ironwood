# Regression tests for native-axiom provenance

The negative cases deliberately impersonate Lean's `native_decide` auxiliaries: most declare an
axiom named like an auxiliary, and one instead names a *theorem* so that its own genuine auxiliary
imitates the marker path. They live in this test-only library so the production `Zcash` library
never imports them.

/-- The certificate lives in an auto-param, so the axiom is emitted while elaborating the
structure instance below rather than a tactic block of its own. Lean then records the auxiliary's
end position at the start of the *next* token — past the end of the owning declaration — which is
why ownership is decided by the auxiliary's start position. `CompElliptic`'s Tonelli–Shanks data
(`pallasBase`, `vestaBase`) is the census entry with this shape. -/

reached against the set the named owners actually own, so an annotation that names only the first

namespace AliasedOwner

/-! A certifying declaration whose *own* name contains the marker components. Its auxiliary is
`owner.native_decide.smuggled._native.native_decide.ax_1_1`, so reading ownership off the prefix
before the *first* `_native`/`native_decide` component would credit it to `owner` — collapsing it
onto the legitimate certificate, where a pre-existing `+native(owner)` would cover both and admit
an undisclosed compiler-trust dependency. Ownership is decided by the *last* marker instead, so the
smuggled certificate keeps its own owner and the stale annotation fails the build. -/
