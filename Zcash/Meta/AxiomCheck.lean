# `assert_axioms` — a concise, build-checked trust-boundary bound

A sibling of Mathlib's `assert_no_sorry` (same `collectAxioms` machinery) that asserts an *upper
bound* on a declaration's trusted base. Unlike a `#guard_msgs`-pinned `#print axioms`, it does not
hard-code the pretty-printed axiom list, so it stays green across toolchain bumps that rename the
`native_decide` axiom — while still failing the build the moment a declaration reaches beyond its
declared tier (a `sorry`, an unexpected axiom, or `native_decide` where none was permitted).

The `#guard_msgs`-pinned form remains the right tool when the *exact* axiom set is the claim.

This command is also used in CompElliptic (`CompElliptic/Meta/AxiomCheck.lean`); changes here
should be reflected there and vice versa.

`assert_axioms foo` fails the build unless `foo` depends only on the standard axioms
(`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`) — in particular, no `sorry` and no `native_decide`.

`assert_axioms foo +native` additionally permits `native_decide` compiler-trust axioms, whose exact
names are toolchain-dependent. Any other axiom (including `sorryAx`) is still rejected.

`assert_computable foo` fails the build unless `foo` is a plain `def` — an actual
definition, not marked `noncomputable` — depending on no axioms beyond `propext` / `Quot.sound`.
This is the breaks-as-computed-data check: the data is genuinely computed, and with
`Classical.choice` excluded it cannot have been conjured from mere propositional existence even
in erased positions.

`assert_computable foo +choice` additionally permits `Classical.choice`. Together with the
plain-`def` check this asserts choice enters only through erased `Prop` fields: had it touched the
data, the definition could not have compiled as a plain `def`. `+native` likewise permits
`native_decide` compiler-trust axioms.

The plain-`def` check guards a gap in "computability is compiler-enforced": marking a reduction
`noncomputable` later would still build, silently voiding the convention; this assertion catches
it.
