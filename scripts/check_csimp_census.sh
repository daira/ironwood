# Check that every `@[csimp]` declaration in the library is covered by an
# `assert_axioms` entry in some census file. The compiler applies a
# csimp substitution in all downstream compiled code, but the axioms of the lemma's
# own proof are not propagated into downstream `native_decide` axiom tracking (
# lean4#7463), so a csimp lemma whose axioms go unchecked would be an
# axiom-smuggling channel.
#
# Robustness: every line containing "csimp" is scanned. Documentation must quote
# mentions as exactly `@[csimp]` (backtick-quoted); that exact string is removed
# before testing, so any remaining attribute syntax (`@[..., csimp, ...]` or
# `attribute [csimp] name`) is treated as real and must name its declaration on
# the same line. An `attribute` command may list several targets; every one is
# checked, and an unparsable target fails rather than being skipped. The same-line
# rule is load-bearing: a target continued onto the next line is invisible to a
# line scanner. Matching against the census is by the declaration's final name
# component.
#
# Scope: this guards against accidental omissions, NOT adversarial code. Run from
# the repository root; exits non-zero on violation.

# exercise the rejection paths of the census macros themselves, including a csimp
# lemma resting on a bespoke axiom. Censusing those would assert the very axiom set
# the fixture exists to be rejected for.

# Zcash/TrustBoundary.lean: entries are spread across the per-fixture boundaries and the test-only
# libraries, and a lemma is pinned wherever its entry sits; requiring the main file would reject a
# legitimate pin in a fixture boundary, and cannot be satisfied at all by a csimp lemma in a
# test-only library that production must not import (`Zcash/Meta/Tests/`, the `MetaCheck` target).
#
# Widening the search to those files means excluding `#guard_msgs`-wrapped entries, which assert
# that a census entry *fails* and so are the opposite of coverage. They sit at column 0 like real
# entries -- the wrapper is the preceding line -- and `Zcash/Meta/Tests/` is full of them, so an
# expected-to-fail entry would otherwise satisfy this check.
