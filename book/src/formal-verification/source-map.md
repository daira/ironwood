# Source Map

A directory-by-directory index of the Lean development under [`Zcash/`](https://github.com/zcash/ironwood/tree/main/Zcash):
what each subtree contains and where to start reading. It is the source-tree companion
to the [proof map](proof-map.md) (which traces how the results connect), the
[security definitions](security-definitions.md) (which state the properties being proven),
and the [glossary](glossary.md) (which defines the coined terms).

The development has four tiers. **`Zcash/Arithmetic/`** holds the objects the other three are
stated over — the scalar field, the verifier group and its reference string, the fingerprint
multiscalar multiplication, and the transform machinery and fast kernels behind them.
**`Zcash/Snark/`** is verifier soundness for the deployed Halo 2 verifier — an accepting proof is
bound to a witness satisfying the circuit, or else an explicit break of a hardness assumption is
computed. **`Zcash/Circuits/`** is the circuit layer — a port of the Orchard Action circuit onto
Clean's Halo 2 formalization, saying what satisfying that circuit means in protocol terms, with
`Integration/` carrying the Clean-to-Ironwood boundary. **`Zcash/Security/`** is the protocol
security-property layer — the binding-signature balance, key-binding, and ledger-model games built
on top. A small set of shared leaves (`Zcash/Common/`, `Zcash/Meta/`) and a library-wide trust
census (`Zcash/TrustBoundary.lean`) support all four.

Each `.lean` file carries a module docstring with the details; this page stays at the
directory level, naming the notable modules as entry points.

## Top level — `Zcash/`

- **`Common/`** — shared leaves that two tiers need and neither should import the other for.
  `DiscreteLogRelation` carries a nontrivial `F`-linear (discrete-log) relation among a family of
  generators as *computed data* — the coefficients — so the reduction-style security arguments can
  produce a break rather than merely assert one exists (see *breaks as computed data* on the
  [Formal Verification](../formal-verification.md) page). `Expr` is the gate-polynomial AST exactly
  as halo2 evaluates it, produced by the circuit-side VK-match projection and consumed by the
  verifier stack. `RelationWitness` supplies the combinators for sequencing a computed break branch:
  a conclusion `A ⊕' R` cannot be case-split classically, so composing such reductions — and
  commuting a family of them past `∀` — needs explicit searches rather than `by_cases`. `ParMap` is
  `List.map` on the task runtime, proven equal to `List.map` definitionally.
- **`Meta/`** — build-time metaprogramming. `AxiomCheck` provides `assert_axioms`, a sibling
  of Mathlib's `assert_no_sorry` that asserts an *upper bound* on a declaration's trusted
  base without hard-coding the pretty-printed axiom list, so the trust pins stay green across
  toolchain bumps that rename the `native_decide` axiom, and `assert_computable`, which additionally
  requires the declaration to be a plain `def`.
- **`Arithmetic.lean`** — the tier's root module, and the only place in the repository that earns
  root vocabulary: `Fp` and `URS` are re-exported at `Zcash` so every module finds them by the
  enclosing-namespace walk.
- **`TrustBoundary.lean`** — the library-wide census that makes the trust claims build-time
  checks rather than prose: a change that widens any checked declaration's trusted base — a
  reachable `sorry`, an unexpected axiom, or `native_decide` where none was permitted — fails
  the build here. Computed break reductions are pinned with `assert_computable`, theorems with
  `assert_axioms`. The SNARK-side censuses were consolidated into this one file, so apart from
  the two per-capture fixture boundaries below it is the single place the trust claims are pinned.

## Arithmetic — `Zcash/Arithmetic/`

The objects every other tier is stated over, and the evaluation lanes that make the concrete
computations affordable. Most of these names stay qualified; a module that wants one opens
`Zcash.Arithmetic` for exactly that name.

`Field` fixes the scalar field `F_p` (Vesta's scalar = Pallas base) and its cardinality, which
appears in every Schwartz–Zippel bound; `Group` fixes the verifier group `E_q` (Vesta) and the
uniform reference string as an `F`-module, with the concrete instantiation unconditional —
CompElliptic's Vesta curve is a proven `AddCommGroup` and its order is pinned with no assumption —
and `VestaModule` supplies that module instance as a plain `def`. `Msm` is the fingerprint
multiscalar multiplication the verifier collapses its whole check into, mirroring halo2's `MSM<C>`,
and `FastMsm` gives it a windowed Pippenger evaluation path registered with `@[csimp]`, so the
fixtures' `native_decide` auxiliaries run fast while the statement surface is untouched.

The transform stack is what the verifying-key derivation spends: `Domain` (halo2's domain scalars
— `omegaOf`, `DELTA`, the primitive-root facts, bridged to CompElliptic's certified Pasta root),
`Fft` (`bestFftG`, halo2's `best_fft` over an arbitrary `Fp`-module, so the scalar and group
instances share one definition), `FftSpec` (its full DFT specification, `bestFftG_dft`), `InvDft`
and `ScalarInvDft`, `LagrangeBasis` (the closed coefficient form `ℓ_i = n⁻¹ · Σ_t ω^{-i·t} Xᵗ`),
and `CommitLagrange` (the per-column committer, which inverse-DFTs the coefficients as *scalars*
and commits against the monomial basis, so no group FFT is ever evaluated). `NatKernel` and
`NatKernelEquiv` are the dictionary-free evaluation lane underneath — projective Vesta points as
canonical-`ℕ` triples dispatching to GMP under the interpreter, proven equal to the
statement-surface functions.

## Verifier soundness — `Zcash/Snark/`

### `Core/` — the verifier's proof-side objects

`ProofString` is the proof as opaque field and group elements after canonical decoding;
`Challenges` records the verifier's challenges in squeeze order (`θ, β, γ, y, x`, the multiopen
`x₁…x₄`, and the IPA `ξ, z` and round challenges `uⱼ`). The field, group, and MSM these are read
against live in `Zcash/Arithmetic/`; `Core.lean` is a one-line compatibility shim re-exporting
`Msm` at `Zcash.Snark` for the generated captures, to be deleted when they are next regenerated.

### `Verifier/` — the MSM assembly

The pure function that assembles the fingerprint MSM in the exact order of halo2's
`plonk/verifier.rs` — the Lean image of the interactive verifier. `Assemble` and `Checks`
compose the building blocks; `Queries` builds the per-argument opening queries and
`QueryCommitment` resolves each assembled query back to the canonical group element it references;
`Expressions` recomputes the vanishing argument's `expected_h_eval`; `Ipa` is the
inner-product-argument opening (`compute_s` / `compute_b`); `FiatShamir` models halo2's Blake2b
challenge schedule as an abstract `squeeze`; `Parametric` proves the assembly and schedule traverse
every sub-proof for an arbitrary proof count (every consensus-valid Orchard action count is one
instance).

### `Keygen/` — the verifying key, derived rather than assumed

The circuit-side half of halo2's `keygen_vk`. `Pipeline` is the single generic route from a closed
`TopLevelCircuit` and a monomial URS to a full `VerifyingKey`: Clean's `Halo2.Keygen` supplies the
pinned constraint system, domain exponent and selector map, and this module adds the group side.
`Derivation` instantiates it at the closed Orchard Action circuit — every definition there is a
`TopLevelCircuit` method applied to `actionCircuit` — and is what ordinary clients consume.
`Lagrange` spends the closed Lagrange coefficient rows on the verifier-side commitment keys, and
closes the loop from the other side: the derived Lagrange basis's `i`-th entry is the monomial
commitment to that same closed row. `Certificate` holds the expensive part — one bundled
`native_decide` comparing every field of the derived key against the capture — and is built only in
the fixture lane.

### `Fingerprint/` — the cross-check and its soundness

`Match` is the fingerprint match: running the deployed Rust verifier and the Lean `assemble`
on the same proof and challenges and comparing the assembled MSMs coefficient-for-coefficient
— the cross-check that validates the Lean assembly in place of a line-by-line translation
proof. `SchwartzZippel` and `Batch` supply the soundness bounds: a fingerprint agrees with a
random evaluation, and a random-linear-combination batch is the identity, only with negligible
probability.

### `Fixtures/` — captured proofs and boundary checks

Concrete Orchard captures that exercise the assembly end-to-end and make the Rust/Lean boundary
less silent. This subtree is the `FixtureCheck` lake target, kept out of `lake build Zcash` (the
captures are large, generated, and slow) but built by CI; the target's glob also names
`Soundness.Deployed.ActionVesta`, which extends the same instance-level lane to the verifying-key
commitment certificate chain. `MaxShape` specializes the verifier shape to the captured column and
query dimensions while leaving the action count free, and `MaxShapeBounds` and
`StraightLineMaxShapeBounds` evaluate the composite bounds at that shape and at the consensus
maximum; `ScheduleMarker` re-encodes captured Fiat–Shamir schedules into the model's marker form;
`PostNu63` pins the canonical post-NU 6.3 verifying key and URS so fixture drift is visible here;
`InstanceWitness` computes the inverse DFT of each capture's public inputs in Lean and checks it
twice — its monomial commitment under halo2's default blind is the commitment the deployed verifier
used, and its polynomial takes the public inputs on every domain row.

`SingleAction/` and `MultiAction/` hold the captured single- and multi-action proofs, each with its
**Fiat–Shamir** schedule check and its checked `TrustBoundary` turning the fingerprint match into
build-time obligations; `SingleAction/VkMatch` computes the capture's constraint-system fields equal
to the ones derived end to end from the ported `configure`. The multi-action capture additionally
carries the shape/VK **faithfulness** checks, the adversarial **negative** fixtures, the degree,
schedule and static-check modules, the two knowledge-error endpoints (compressed-identity and
straight-line), and `CapturedZeroFamily` — the shape-generic zero prover instantiated at the
captured key's own scalar data, so the staged IPA trace carries eleven live rounds.

### `Soundness/` — the soundness argument

The core argument that an accepting proof yields a witness or a computed break. The top-level
modules cover the argument end to end: `Main` (conditional soundness and the deployed-acceptance
route), `KnowledgeSoundness` (the `SnarkRelation` knowledge-soundness relation), `Constraints`
(Schwartz–Zippel soundness of the vanishing check) with `FoldSplit` (recovering the individual
constraints from the verifier's `y`-fold), `ConstraintCore` and `ConstraintRouting` (the
rewind-free deterministic identities the algebraic decoder consumes), `ConstraintRelations` (what
the capstone's satisfaction predicate buys the row-level results), `DegreeWalk` (an explicit degree
bound `D` for the combined constraint difference, hence `εx = D / |𝔽|`), and
`GoodChallenge`/`ChallengePricing` (deriving the good-challenge exclusions from challenge
uniformity rather than assuming them). The permutation/lookup stack is `GrandProduct` — the shared
grand-product-to-multiset kernel — with `RunningProduct` (telescoping the running product),
`GrandProductBridge` (the two Schwartz–Zippel steps from the verifier's evaluated check to the
multiset identity), `Permutation`, `PermutationConstruction`, `PermutationRows`, `Lookup`, and
`LookupAssembly`. The IPA stack is `InnerProduct`, `IpaSoundness`, `Extraction`, `Consistency`,
`CommitFold`. `InstanceBinding` closes the public-instance gap — a decoded instance column is the
polynomial halo2 committed from its `instances` argument, on pain of a computed `(g, U, W)`
relation — and `ZeroData` supplies the zero-data multiopen keystone the constant prover families
are built on. `Vesta` pins the abstract group to the actual Vesta curve. `TopLevelTerminal` and `TopLevelVesta` connect verifier acceptance to the Spec of an arbitrary top-level circuit, using that circuit's derived verifier key. `ActionVesta` specializes them to our concrete Lean model of the Action circuit.

Six subtrees carry the heavier machinery:

- **`AGM/`** — the algebraic-group-model layer. It turns the relation coefficients computed
  from algebraic prover data (`Peel`, `Capstone`) into a discrete-log solution over the
  augmented basis `(g, U, W)` (`Adapter`, following Fuchsbauer–Kiltz–Loss), adds the algebraic
  coefficients to the prover and forking-certificate interfaces (`Prover`), feeds the
  binding-signature relations in as AGM inputs (`BindingSignature`), and prices the reduction
  (`Probability`, `ProbabilityCoins`, `ProbabilityVesta`) — programming *every* basis slot from the
  DL challenge rather than guessing which slot the relation will hit, so the loss is an additive
  `1/|F|` with no multiplicative factor. The bulk of the subtree is the rewind-free deployed
  decoder: the unbatching chain (`AlgebraicUnbatch`, `DeployedX1`, `DeployedMultiopen`,
  `ValueUnbatch`, `DeployedValueUnbatch`, `ShiftRecovery`), the coordinate decode
  (`RepresentationDecode`, `DeployedCoordinateDecode`, `DirectX4Columns`, `DirectConstraintFamily`),
  the explicit root sets it must avoid (`DeployedRootSets`, `DeployedRootDecode`,
  `DeployedPinnedRoots`, `PinnedRootWitness`), the retained-provenance route (`OnlineMembers`,
  `OnlineMultiopen`, `OnlineConstraint`, `DeployedConstraintSupply`), and the adapters back onto
  the historical opened-batch interface (`SyntheticOpened`, `DeployedSyntheticOpened`,
  `DecodeToOpened`). `StraightLineIpa` and `StraightLinePinnedRoots` classify one accepting
  algebraic transcript as a clean opening, an explicit relation, or a squeeze-pinned bad-challenge
  event, from a single execution with no rewinding; `StraightLineFiniteSecurity` records group
  work, random-oracle queries and direct-decode field work as distinct quantities and asserts no
  generic-group DLOG formula. `ZeroFamily` and `ZeroFamilyRoots` are the constant zero-data prover
  at an arbitrary shape, whose multiopen obligation reduces to `0 = 0`.
- **`Canonical/`** — the verifier-native constraint model the circuit layer is handed. It installs
  the fixed selector triple into the commitment-ID resolver (`ConstraintModel`, `DomainSelectors`),
  recovers the three constraint families from the flat `y`-folded list (`ConstraintSatisfaction`),
  interpolates rows on the `ω` domain (`PolynomialEnvironment`), joins halo2's Lagrange-basis
  instance commitments to the extractor's monomial coefficient vectors (`InstanceCommitment`), and
  instantiates the permutation and lookup arguments at routed decoded polynomials
  (`PermutationInstantiation`, `PermutationSemantics`, `LookupInstantiation`, `LookupSemantics`,
  `LookupRows`), ending at `Terminal` and its Vesta adapter.
- **`Composition/`** — joining the architecturally disjoint halves and pricing the result. `Bridge`
  identifies the algebraic forking extraction's clean opening with the deployed decoded capstone's
  opened commitment; `Decomposition` splits the knowledge-error bound unconditionally into the
  priced clean-opening failure plus a measured clean-but-not-extracted residual.
  `DeployedAcceptance` and `DeployedRuntime` isolate the deployed decision from the historical
  rewind construction; `RootContainment`, `DeployedRootContainment` and
  `DeployedConstraintContainment` replace the four-level joint-event coupling with a finite union
  of explicit bad-root events, each fixed before its own squeeze, so the residual is additive and
  has no fourth root. `Quotient` reconstructs a genuinely pre-`x` quotient, `PrefixedSqueeze` and
  `ScheduleBudget` price the `x` squeeze, and `ActionBudget` and `AlgebraicRootBudget` cap the
  action-dependent counts at the consensus maximum. The straight-line route is
  `StraightLineDeployed` (the primary deployed path), `StraightLineConstraint`,
  `StraightLineDecodeSupply`, and the two inhabitants of its interface — `StraightLineWitness` at
  the degenerate shape and `ZeroStraightLine` with eleven live IPA rounds.
  `SemanticChallengeRemainder` prices the bundle-wide `y`/`β`/`γ`/`θ` exclusions the Action-level
  statement needs, and `DirectPathCost` bounds the direct-coordinate postprocessing's field
  operations and data traversal by a shape polynomial with no `|F|` term.
- **`Deployed/`** — the bridge from the clean, abstract soundness onto halo2's actual deployed
  IPA. It models the deployed IPA's `U`/`W` apparatus and peels it onto the clean recursive IPA
  (`Ipa`, `IpaPeel`), unfolds the flattened deployed MSM into the recursive generator fold
  (`Fold`), shows deployed acceptance implies halo2's explicit IPA verifier equation
  (`Verification`), reduces binding over the augmented generators to discrete-log-relation
  hardness (`Binding`), reads the fork-tree knowledge error off the deployed Orchard parameters as
  a concrete number (`ConcreteBounds` — `33/|F_p| ≈ 2⁻²⁴⁹` at the captured depth `k = 11`), and
  states the Action capstone at the captured artifacts (`ActionVesta`).
- **`Forking/`** — the reusable Fiat–Shamir forking kernel: random-oracle primitives
  (`Oracle`), the deployed round ordering and rewinding (`Ordering`, `Rewind`), fork-tree
  existence and the forking-lemma probability bound (`Tree`, `Probability`), the closed form
  of that bound (`KnowledgeError`), the transcript assembly and extraction that turn forked
  transcripts into a deployed IPA tree (`Assembly`, `Extractor`), the one-level pinned-squeeze
  bound and the additive union of pinned root events (`PinnedSqueeze`, `PinnedRoots`), and the
  wrapper that returns a run's own oracle reads with its output (`WithReads`).
  **`Forking/Adversary/`** builds the querying-adversary reduction on top: the `Q`-query
  adaptive adversary model (`OracleComp`), executable recursive forking from a finite tape
  (`Recursive`), the Fiat–Shamir-to-AGM handoff (`Algebraic`), oracle-domain reduction to
  finite support (`DomainReduction`), the adaptive interface and pre-IPA query accounting
  (`Adaptive`, `PreIpa`, `Provenance`), and the expected-run bookkeeping (`ExpectedRuns`,
  `ExpectedRunsPoly`). The efficiency floor is unconditional: `afkRunBound Q k = (8Q + 1) · 10^k`
  follows from the adversary's query bound alone, field-independent and with no premise on the
  fork DAG. That is a ~40-bit cost against the straight-line route's four prover invocations,
  which is why the recursive route is retained as a separately priced alternative rather than the
  path the headline rests on.
- **`Multiopen/`** — the multiopen argument's value binding. `Decode` recovers the individual
  columns from openings of the batch at enough distinct batching challenges, and `Deployed`
  discharges the flat-power-batch shape those openings are stated in against the deployed verifier
  rather than assuming it; `Compat` is the MSM evaluation spine; `RPoly` supplies the interpolation
  core (Mathlib's `Lagrange.interpolate`, plus the bridge to the deployed `foldl`); `Claimed`,
  `Opened`, `ValueCheck`, `ValueCheckDeployed`, and `NodeBinding` bind each decoded aggregate
  column to its claimed evaluation; and `ConstraintResolver`, `CanonicalSelection` and
  `CanonicalRelation` route the decoded members into the canonical constraint model, which is the
  semantic handoff to the formal circuit.

## Circuit layer — `Zcash/Circuits/`

A port of the Orchard Action circuit onto [Clean](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/clean)'s
Halo 2 formalization, with elliptic-curve arithmetic from
[CompElliptic](https://github.com/daira/CompElliptic). Each chip is ported from the actual Rust
(`orchard@0.14.0`, `halo2_gadgets-0.5.0`) rather than from memory, and the module docstrings cite
the source lines. Where the Sinsemilla incomplete-addition escapes can fire, the statements carry
them as data (`SpecOrBreak`) rather than assuming them away.

- **`Specs/`** — the value-level protocol specifications the circuits are proven against:
  Orchard data shapes (`Types`), the Pallas curve and its certified arithmetic (`Pallas`,
  `PallasCert`, `CompEllipticExtras`), bit-range arithmetic (`Bitrange`), and the Sinsemilla
  hash with its generators and break structure (`Sinsemilla`, `SinsemillaGenerators`,
  `SinsemillaBreak`).
- **`Utilities/`** — the shared gadgets: `LookupRangeCheck` (the first lookup-consuming gadget
  ported, generic over `K`), `RunningSum`/`DecomposeRunningSum`, `CondSwap`, and `AddChip`.
- **`Ecc/`** — the ECC chip. Point witnessing (`WitnessPoint`), complete and incomplete addition
  (`Add`, `AddIncomplete`), variable-base multiplication in its incomplete/complete/overflow
  phases (`Mul`, `MulIncomplete`, `MulIncompleteRound`, `MulComplete`, `MulOverflow`,
  `DoubleAndAdd`), and fixed-base multiplication (`MulFixed/`, with full-width, short, and
  base-field-element variants). **`MulFixed/Certs/`** holds the six deployed fixed bases with
  their window-table certificates, checked through `CertCheck`'s `ℕ`-literal evaluator.
- **`Sinsemilla/`** — the Sinsemilla chip: the `2^K` generator table (`Basic`), one hash piece
  and its rounds (`HashPiece`, `HashPieceRound`), the `⊥`-propagating chain (`Chain`,
  `HashToPoint`), the commit domain (`CommitDomain`), and the fixed-depth Merkle path (`Merkle`).
- **`Poseidon/`** — the Poseidon chip: the `pow5` S-box and round structure (`Pow5`, `Rounds`,
  `Constants`), the permutation (`Permute`), and the sponge/hash at `ConstantLength<2>` (`Hash`).
- **`NoteCommit/`** and **`CommitIvk/`** — the two commitment circuits, each as pieces and
  decompositions, the gate set, the canonicity checks, and the assembled `Main`/`MainBundle`
  contract at the extracted window scalar.
- **`Action/`** — the top-level Orchard Action circuit. `Circuit` is the ironwood `configure`
  and `synthesize` in exact region-creation order; `CircuitPreIronwood` is the post-NU 6.2
  circuit without the cross-address region (both share `configure`);
  `RealBases` instantiates everything at the actual deployed constants; `PublicInput` declares the
  public instance-cell layout and splits the semantic witness into public and private halves;
  `SelectorCoherence` certifies that every selector reference the configure program registers was
  allocated by that same program; the per-check modules are `ValueCommit`, `DeriveNullifier`,
  `SpendAuthority`, and `AddressIntegrity`; `Bundle` is the end-to-end statement against protocol
  spec §4.17.4; and `TopLevel` presents the whole thing as a closed `TopLevelCircuit`.
- **`Integration/`** — the Clean-to-Ironwood boundary, and the largest directory in the tree. Only
  modules that *translate* belong here; pure verifier-native constraint, permutation and lookup
  mathematics stays in `Zcash/Snark/`. It compiles the circuit's declared structure into what the
  verifier's soundness model quantifies over: gates and lookups from the operation stream
  (`OperationGates`, `OperationLookups`, `OperationFixed`, `OperationCopies`), the permutation
  round trip (`PermutationCompiler`, `PermutationReplay`, `CopyListMembership`), the layout and
  selector compilers (`FixedLayout`, `SelectorCoherence`, `LookupSelectorRows`, `QueryLayouts`),
  the commitment provenance of the fixed, σ and instance columns (`FixedColumns`,
  `PermutationColumns`, `InstanceColumns`), the resolver-backed environments (`ResolverGates`,
  `ResolverQueryEnvironment`, `PolynomialEnvironment`, `ExprRich`), and the reassembly of full
  circuit satisfaction (`CircuitSatisfaction`, `CircuitIntegration`). The `Action*` modules
  specialize all of that to the deployed Action circuit and land at `ActionTerminal`; the
  `TopLevel*` modules are the circuit-generic versions. `StraightLineActionTerminal` reaches that
  same terminal from one accepting execution instead of a rewinding one, and
  `StraightLineActionEvent` prices the challenge exclusions it leaves open, bounding the
  probability that an accepting run carries neither the bundle statement nor a nontrivial relation.
- **`Fixtures/`** and **`Tests/`** — the VK cross-check against Rust. `Fixtures/` reconstructs,
  purely and computably, the layout products a keygen-view dump pins (the ordered copy list, the
  permutation σ, the fixed assignments) from a circuit's `Operations`, with the dumps carried as
  JSON data files (`Json`) and their SHA-256 pins as Lean data (`Stamp`, generated, the module that
  carries a fixture change into Lake's import graph); `Tests/` checks that the ported `configure` is equal
  to those dumps' post-`compress_selectors`, and is the `CircuitCheck` lake target —
  like `FixtureCheck`, kept out of `lake build Zcash` but compiled by CI, with the glob covering the
  whole directory so a newly added test cannot land in no target at all.

## Protocol security — `Zcash/Security/`

The security-property games layered on the verifier, all in the reduction style: a property
violation *exhibits* a concrete break (a hash collision or a discrete-log relation), carried as
computed data.

- **`Common/`** — the classical random-oracle foundation shared by the games. `RandomOracle`
  is the collision vocabulary (the `Collision` / `CollisionUpToSign` structures); `Birthday`
  is the birthday-bound counting for random-oracle ±-collisions, in the counting-fraction style
  used throughout (no probability monad).
- **`Concrete/`** — `PallasGroup`, the Pallas group behind a small protocol-facing wrapper over
  CompElliptic's affine `SWPoint`, carrying the transported group laws and the scalar-module
  structure the deployed pool's primitives are stated over.
- **`BindingSignature/`** — the binding-signature *balance* argument (spec §4.13 Sapling /
  §4.14 Orchard). `Balance` is the shared algebraic core over an arbitrary `F`-module;
  `Orchard` and `Sapling` add the per-pool no-overflow bounds that keep the value sums below
  the scalar-field order.
- **`KeyBinding/`** — the key-binding theorem (ZIP 2005, ROM). `Basic` is the deterministic
  layer: a verifying Recovery-Statement witness pins the key components (`ak` up to y-sign,
  `nk`, and the `qk`/`sk` branch) to `ivk` unless an explicit break is computed. `Instance`
  bridges that concrete development to the games' `KeyBindingInterface`, `Pool` states it at the
  Orchard Action, and `Probability` adds the whole-table random-oracle model that turns the
  counting facts into a probability bound.
- **`Ledger/`** — the ledger-model games. `Statement` transcribes the games-relevant conjuncts
  of an Orchard-shaped Action statement over abstract primitives — the interface the games
  consume — and `Model` is the witness-annotated ledger they quantify over, with `Effects`
  reading off the outputs, spends, and shielded-pool balance. `Bridge` is deliberately the only
  place that translates an extracted Action circuit witness into that statement, and the only place
  Sinsemilla escapes become break statements, with `BridgeTests` guarding the protocol
  distinctions a type-correct refinement can silently erase and `SinsemillaDLR` carrying a
  classified escape onward as a relation. The games themselves: `Balance` (every nonzero spend is a
  committed output of a strictly earlier transaction, or a Merkle/note-commitment break is
  computed), `Spendability` (the Faerie-Gold core — nullifiers pin note tuples — plus persistence),
  and `SpendAuthority` (an unsigned spend yields a signature forgery or a key-binding break), with
  `Merkle` proving fixed-depth Merkle trees position-binding up to an exhibited tree-hash collision
  and `Nullifier` reducing a nullifier collision to a discrete-log relation. `Pool` instantiates
  the abstract primitives at the deployed pool, `Value` discharges the balance-value premiss
  against the binding-signature layer, `KeyBindingArm` discharges the key-binding ε in the oracle
  model, `Capstone` lifts the deterministic layer to a distribution over valid annotated ledgers,
  and `Completeness` checks the other direction — that an honest wallet's spend actually verifies.
